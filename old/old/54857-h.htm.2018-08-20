    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Sir George Craik, Bart., to Alma Craik.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y dear Niece,-The
      receipt of your letter, dated &lsquo;Lucerne,&rsquo; but bearing the post-mark of
      Geneva, has at last relieved my mind from the weight of anxiety which was
      oppressing it. Thank Heaven you are safe and well, and bear your suffering
      with Christian resignation. In a little time, I trust, you will have left
      this dark passage of your experience quite behind you, and return to us
      looking and feeling like your old self. George, who now, as always, shares
      my affectionate solicitude for you, joins me in expressing that wish. The
      poor boy is still sadly troubled at the remembrance of your misconception,
      and I sometimes think that his health is affected. Do, if you can, try to
      send him a line or a message, assuring him that your unhappy
      misunderstanding is over. Believe me, his one thought in life is to secure
      your good esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no news&mdash;none, that is to say, of any importance. We have
      kept our promise to you, and your secret is still quite safe in our
      custody. The man to whom you owe all this misery is still here, and still,
      I am informed, prostituting the pulpit to his vicious heresies. If report
      is to be believed, his utterances have of late been more extraordinary
      than ever, and he is rapidly losing influence over his own congregation.
      Sometimes I can scarcely conquer my indignation, knowing as I do that with
      one word I could effectually silence his blasphemy, and drive him beyond
      the pale of society. But in crushing him I should disgrace you, and bring
      contempt upon our name; and these considerations, as well as my pledge to
      keep silence, make any kind of public action impossible. I must therefore
      wait patiently till the inevitable course of events, accelerated by an
      indignant Providence, destroys the destroyer of your peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, my dear Alma, let me express my concern and regret that
      you should be wandering from place to place without a protector. I know
      your strength of mind, of course; but you are young and handsome, and the
      world is censorious. Only say the word, and although business of a rather
      important nature occupies me in London, I will put it aside at any cost,
      and join you. In the absence of my dear brother, I am your natural
      guardian. While legally your own mistress, you are morally under my care,
      and I would make any sacrifice to be with you, especially at this critical
      moment of your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I send this letter to the address you have given me at Lucerne. I hope it
      will reach you soon and safely, and that you will, on seeing it, fall in
      with my suggestion that I should come to you without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      With warmest love and sympathy, in which your cousin joins, believe me as
      ever,&mdash;Your affectionate uncle,
    </p>
    <p>
      George Craik.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.

    <p>
      <i>From Alma Craik to Sir George Craik, Bart.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y dear Uncle,&mdash;I
      have just received your letter. Thank you for attending to my request.
      With regard to your suggestion that you should come to me, I know it is
      meant in all kindness, but as I told you before leaving London, I prefer
      at present to be quite alone, with the exception of my maid Hortense. I
      will let you know of my movements from time to time,&mdash;Your
      affectionate niece,
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma Craik.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Alma Craik to the Rev. Ambrose Bradley</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>our letter,
      together with one from my uncle, found me at Lucerne, and brought me at
      once grief and comfort: grief, that you still reproach yourself over what
      was inevitable; comfort, that you are, as you assure me, still
      endeavouring to pursue your religious work. Pray, pray, do not write to me
      in such a strain again. You have neither wrecked my life nor broken my
      heart, as you blame yourself for doing; I learned long ago from our Divine
      Example that the world is one of sorrow, and I am realising the truth in
      my own experience, that is all.
    </p>
    <p>
      You ask me how and where I have spent my days, and whether I have at
      present any fixed destination. I have been wandering, so to speak, among
      the gravestones of the Catholic Church, visiting not only the great
      shrines and cathedrals, but lingering in every obscure roadside chapel,
      and halting at every Calvary, in southern and western France. Thence I
      have come on to Switzerland, where religion grows drearier, and life grows
      dismaller, in the shadow of the mountains. In a few days I shall follow in
      your own footsteps, and go on to Italy&mdash;to Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write to me when you feel impelled to write. You shall be apprised of my
      whereabouts from time to time.&mdash;Yours now as ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S.&mdash;When I sat down to write the above, I thought I had so much to
      say to you; and I have said nothing! Something numbs expression, though my
      thoughts seem full to overflowing. I am like one who longs to speak, yet
      fears to utter a syllable, lest her voice should be clothed with tears and
      sobs. God help me! All the world is changed, and I can hardly realise it,
      yet!
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Ambrose Bradley to Alma Craik.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>earest Alma,&mdash;You
      tell me in your letter that you have said nothing of the thoughts that
      struggle within you for utterance; alas! your words are only too eloquent,
      less in what they say than in what they leave unsaid. If I required any
      reminder of the mischief I have wrought, of the beautiful dream that I
      have destroyed, it would come to me in the pathetic reticence of the
      letter I have just received. Would to God that you had never known me!
      Would to God that, having known me, you would have despised me as I
      deserved! I was unworthy even to touch the hem of your garment. I am like
      a wretch who has profaned the altar of a saint. Your patience and devotion
      are an eternal rebuke. I could bear your bitter blame; I cannot bear your
      forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am here as you left me; a guilty, conscience-stricken creature
      struggling in a world of nightmares. Nothing now seems substantial,
      permanent, or true. Every time that I stand up before my congregation I am
      like a shadow addressing shadows; thought and language both fail me, and I
      know not what platitudes flow from my lips; but when I am left alone
      again, I awaken as from a dream to the horrible reality of my guilt and my
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have thought it all over again and again, trying to discover some course
      by which I might bring succour to myself and peace to her I love; and
      whichever way I look, I see but one path of escape, the rayless descent of
      death. For, so long as I live, I darken your sunshine. My very existence
      is a reminder to you of what I am, of what I might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there, I will not pain you with my penitence, and I will hush my
      self-reproaches in deference to your desire. Though the staff you placed
      in my hand has become a reed, and though I seem to have no longer any
      foothold on the solid ground of life, I will try to struggle on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dare not ask you to write to me&mdash;it seems an outrage to beg for
      such a blessing; yet I know that you <i>will</i> pity me, and write again.&mdash;Ever
      yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      Ambrose Bradley.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>radley&rsquo;s letter
      was fowarded from Lucerne after some little delay, and reached Miss Craik
      at Brieg, just as she was preparing to proceed by private conveyance to
      Domo d&rsquo;Ossola. She had taken the carriage and pair for herself and her
      maid, a young Frenchwoman; and as the vehicle rounded its zigzag course
      towards the Klenenhorn she perused the epistle line by line, until she had
      learned almost every word by heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with the letter lying in her lap, she gazed sadly, almost vacantly,
      around her on the gloomy forests and distant hills, the precipices spanned
      by aerial bridges, the quaint villages clinging like birds&rsquo;-nests here and
      there, the dark vistas of mountain side gashed by torrents frozen by
      distance to dazzling white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreary beyond measure, though the skies were blue and the air full of
      golden sunlight, seemed the wonderful scene:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We make the world we look on, and create
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The summer or the winter with our seeing!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And cold and wintry indeed was all that Alma beheld that summer day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even the glorious panorama unfolded beneath her gaze on passing the
      Second Refuge had any charms to please her saddened sight. Leaving the
      lovely valley of the Rhone, sparkling in sunlight, encircled by the
      snow-crowned Alps, with the Jungfrau towering paramount, crowned with
      glittering icy splendour and resting against a heaven of deep insufferable
      blue, she passed through avenues of larch and fir, over dizzy bridges,
      past the lovely glacier of the Kallwasser, till she reached the high
      ascent of the Fifth Refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the coarse spirit of the age arose before her, in the shape of a
      party of English and American tourists crowding the diligence and
      descending noisily for refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later she passed the barrier toll, and came in sight of the Cross
      of &rsquo;Vantage. She arrested the carriage, and descended for a few
      minutes, standing as it were suspended in mid air, in full view of glacier
      upon glacier, closed in by the mighty chain of the Bernese Alps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had she felt so utterly solitary. The beautiful world, the empty
      sky, swam before her in all the loveliness of desolation, and turning her
      face towards Aletsch, she wept bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stood thus, she was suddenly conscious of another figure standing
      near to her, as if in rapt contemplation of the solemn scene. It was that
      of a middle-aged man, rather above the middle stature, who carried a small
      knapsack on his shoulders and leant upon an Alpine staff. She saw only his
      side face, and his eyes were turned away; yet, curiously enough, his form
      had an air of listening watchfulness, and the moment she was conscious of
      his presence he turned and smiled, and raised his hat. She noticed then
      that his sunburnt face was clean shaven, like that of a priest, and that
      his eyes were black and piercing, though remarkably good-humoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon, Madame,&rsquo; he said in French, &lsquo;but I think we have met before.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had turned away her head to hide her tears from the stranger&rsquo;s gaze.
      Without waiting for her answer, he proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the hotel at Brieg. I was staying there when Madame arrived, and I
      left at daybreak this morning to cross the Pass on foot.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time she had mastered her agitation, and could regard the stranger
      with a certain self-possession. His face, though not handsome, was mobile
      and expressive; the eyebrows were black and prominent, the forehead was
      high, the mouth large and well cut, with glittering white teeth. It was
      difficult to tell the man&rsquo;s age; for though his countenance was so fresh
      that it looked quite young, his forehead and cheeks, in repose, showed
      strongly-marked lines; and though his form seemed strong and agile, he
      stooped greatly at the shoulders. To complete the contradiction, his hair
      was as white as snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      What mark is it that Rome puts upon her servants, that we seem to know
      them under almost any habit or disguise? One glance convinced Alma that
      the stranger either belonged to some of the holy orders, or was a lay
      priest of the Romish Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not remember to have seen you before, Monsieur,&rsquo; she replied, also
      in French, with a certain hauteur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger smiled again, and bowed apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps I was wrong to address Madame without a more formal introduction.
      I know that in England it is not the custom. But here on the mountain, far
      away from the conventions of the world, it would be strange, would it not,
      to meet in silence? We are like two souls that encounter on pilgrimage,
      both looking wearily towards the Celestial Gate.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you a priest, Monsieur?&rsquo; asked Alma abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A poor member of the Church, the Abbé Brest. I am journeying on foot
      through the Simplon to the Lago Maggiore, and thence, with God&rsquo;s blessing,
      to Milan. But I shall rest yonder, at the New Hospice, to-night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he pointed across the mountain towards the refuge of the monks of St.
      Bernard, close to the region of perpetual snow. The tall figure of an
      Augustine monk, shading his eyes and looking up the road was visible; and
      from the refectory within came the faint tolling of a bell mingled from
      time to time with the deep barking of a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The monks receive travellers still?&rsquo; asked Alma. &lsquo;I suppose the Hospice
      is rapidly becoming, like its compeers, nothing more or less than a big
      hotel?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please do not call me Madame. I am unmarried.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke almost without reflection, and it was not until she had uttered
      the words that their significance dawned upon her. Her face became crimson
      with sudden shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of the stranger that he noticed the change in a
      moment, but that, immediately on doing so, he turned away his eyes and
      seemed deeply interested in the distant prospect, while he replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have again to ask your pardon for my stupidity. Mademoiselle, of
      course, is English?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And is therefore, perhaps, a little prejudiced against those who, like
      the good monks of the Hospice, shut themselves from all human
      companionship, save that of the wayfarers whom they live to save and
      shelter? Yet, believe me, it is a life of sacred service! Even here, among
      the lonely snows, reaches the arm of the Holy Mother, to plant this cross
      by the wayside, as a symbol of her heavenly inspiration, and to build that
      holy resting-place as a haven for those who are weary and would rest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with the same soft insinuating smile as before, but his eye
      kindled, and his pale face flushed with enthusiasm. Alma, who had turned
      towards the carriage which stood awaiting her, looked at him with new
      interest. Something in his words chimed in with a secret longing of her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been taught to believe, Monsieur, that your faith is practically
      dead. Everywhere we see, instead of its living temples, only the ruins of
      its old power. If its spirit exists still, it is only in places such as
      this, in company with loneliness and death.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, but Mademoiselle is mistaken!&rsquo; returned the other, following by her
      side as she walked slowly towards the carriage. &lsquo;Had you seen what I have
      seen, if you knew what I know, of the great Catholic reaction, you would
      think differently. Other creeds, gloomier and more ambitious, have
      displaced ours for a time in your England; but let me ask you&mdash;you,
      Mademoiselle, who have a truly religious spirit&mdash;you who have
      yourself suffered&mdash;what have those other creeds done for humanity?
      Believe me, little or nothing. In times of despair and doubt, the world
      will again turn to its first Comforter, the ever-patient and ever-loving
      Church of Christ.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They had by this time reached the carriage door. The stranger bowed again
      and assisted Alma to her seat. Then he raised his hat with profound
      respect in sign of farewell. The coachman was about to drive on when Alma
      signed for him to delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am on my way to Domo d&rsquo;Ossola,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;A seat in my carriage is at
      your service if you would prefer going on to remaining at the Hospice for
      the night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle, it is too much! I could not think of obtruding myself upon
      you! I, a stranger!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he seemed to look longingly at the comfortable seat in the vehicle,
      and to require little more pressing to accept the offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray do not hesitate,&rsquo; said Alma, smiling, &lsquo;unless you prefer the company
      of the monks of the mountain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After that, I can hesitate no longer,&rsquo; returned the Abbé, looking radiant
      with delight; and he forthwith entered the vehicle and placed himself by
      Alma&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it came to pass that my heroine descended the Pass of the Simplon in
      company with her new acquaintance, an avowed member of a Church for which
      she had felt very little sympathy until that hour. To do him justice, I
      must record the fact that she found him a most interesting companion. His
      knowledge of the world was extensive, his learning little short of
      profound, his manners were charming. He knew every inch of the way, and
      pointed out the objects of interest, digressing lightly into the topics
      they awakened. At every turn the prospect brightened. Leaving the wild and
      barren slopes behind them, the travellers passed through emerald
      pasturages, and through reaches of foliage broken by sounding torrents,
      and at last emerging from the great valley, and crossing the bridge of
      Crevola, they found themselves surrounded on every side by vineyards,
      orchards, and green meadows. When the carriage drew up before the door of
      the hotel at Domo d&rsquo;Ossola, Alma felt that the time had passed as if under
      enchantment. Although she had spoken very little, she had quite
      unconsciously informed her new friend of three facts&mdash;that she was a
      wealthy young Englishwoman travelling through Europe at her own free will;
      that she had undergone an unhappy experience, involving, doubtless, some
      person of the opposite sex; and that, in despair of comfort from creeds
      colder and less forgiving, she was just in a fit state of mind to seek
      refuge in the bosom of the Church of Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The acquaintance, begun so curiously in the Simplon Pass, was destined to
      continue. At Domo d&rsquo;Ossola, Alma parted from the Abbé Brest, whose
      destination was some obscure village on the banks of Lago Maggiore; but a
      few weeks later, when staying at Milan, she encountered him again. She had
      ascended the tower of the Duomo, and was gazing down on the streets and
      marts of the beautiful city, when she heard a voice behind her murmuring
      her name, and turning somewhat nervously, she encountered the bright black
      eyes of the wandering Abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accosted her with his characteristic <i>bonhomie</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Mademoiselle, it <i>is</i> you!&rsquo; he cried smiling. &lsquo;We are destined
      to meet in the high places&mdash;here on the tower of the cathedral, there
      on the heights of the Simplon!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something so unexpected, so mysterious in the man&rsquo;s
      reappearance, that Alma was startled in spite of herself, but she greeted
      him courteously, and they descended the tower steps together. The Abbé
      kept a solemn silence as they walked through the sacred building, with its
      mighty walls of white marble, its gorgeous decorations, its antique tombs,
      its works in bronze and in mosaic; but when they passed from the porch
      into the open sunlight, he became as garrulous as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked along together in the direction of the Grand Hotel, where Alma
      was staying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you driven out to the cathedral at Monza?&rsquo; inquired the Abbé in the
      course of their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; is it worth seeing?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly. Besides, it contains the sacred crown of Lombardy, the iron
      band of which is made out of nails from the true cross.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; exclaimed Alma with a smile that was incredulous, even
      contemptuous. She glanced at her companion, and saw that he was smiling
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until she had been some weeks away from England that Alma Craik
      quite realised her position in the world. In the first wild excitement of
      her flight her only feeling was one of bewildered agitation, mingled with
      a mad impulse to return upon her own footsteps, and, reckless of the
      world&rsquo;s opinion, take her place by Bradley&rsquo;s side. A word of encouragement
      from him at that period would have decided her fate. But after the first
      pang of grief was over, after she was capable of regretful retrospection,
      her spirit became numbed with utter despair. She found herself solitary,
      friendless, hopeless, afflicted with an incurable moral disease to which
      she was unable to give a name, but which made her long, like the old
      anchorites and penitents, to seek some desert place and yield her life to
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this mood of mind she turned for solace to religion, and found how
      useless for all practical purposes was her creed of beautiful ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her faith in Christian facts had been shaken if not destroyed; the
      Christian myth had the vagueness and strangeness of a dream; yet, true to
      her old instincts, she haunted the temples of the Church, and felt like
      one wandering through a great graveyard of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travelling quite alone, for her maid was in no sense of the words a
      confidante or a companion, she could not fail to awaken curious interest
      in many with whom she was thrown into passing contact. Her extraordinary
      personal beauty was heightened rather than obscured by her singularity of
      dress; for though she wore no wedding-ring, she dressed in black like a
      widow, and had the manners as well as the attire of a person profoundly
      mourning. At the hotels she invariably engaged private apartments, seldom
      or never descending to the public rooms, or joining in the tables-d&rsquo;hote.
      The general impression concerning her was that she was an eccentric young
      Englishwoman of great wealth, recently bereaved of some person very near
      and dear to her, possibly her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she lived in seclusion, resisting all friendly advances, whether on
      the part of foreigners or of her own countrymen; and her acquaintance with
      the Abbé Brest would never have passed beyond a few casual courtesies had
      it not begun under circumstances so peculiar and in a place so solitary,
      or had the man himself been anything but a member of the mysterious Mother
      Church. But the woman&rsquo;s spirit was pining for some kind of guidance, and
      the magnetic name of Rome had already awakened in it a melancholy
      fascination. The strange priest attracted her, firstly, by his eloquent
      personality, secondly, by the authority he seemed to derive from a power
      still pretending to achieve miracles: and though in her heart she despised
      the pretensions and loathed the dogmas of his Church, she felt in his
      presence the sympathy of a prescient mind. For the rest, any
      companionship, if intellectual, was better than utter social isolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the meeting on the tower of the Duomo led to other meetings. The Abbé
      became her constant companion, and her guide through all the many temples
      of the queenly city.

      had so cruelly deceived and wronged was wandering from city to city, and
      trying in vain to find rest and consolation, Ambrose Bradley remained at
      the post where she had left him, the most melancholy soul beneath the sun.
      All his happiness in his work being gone, his ministration lost the
      fervour and originality that had at first been its dominant attraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir George had not exaggerated when he said that the clergyman&rsquo;s flock was
      rapidly falling away from him. New lights were arising; new religious
      whims and oddities were attracting the restless spirits of the metropolis.
      A thought-reading charlatan from the New World, a learned physiologist
      proving the oneness of the sympathetic system with polarised light, a
      maniacal non-jurist asserting the prerogative of affirmation at the bar of
      the House of Commons, became each a nine-days&rsquo; wonder. The utterances of
      the new gospel were forgotten, or disregarded as flatulent and
      unprofitable; and Ambrose Bradley found his occupation gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all this he cared little or nothing. He was too lost in contemplation
      of his own moral misery. All his thought and prayer being to escape from
      this, he tried various distractions&mdash;the theatre, for example, with
      its provincial theory of edification grafted on the dry stem of what had
      once been a tree of literature. He was utterly objectless and miserable,
      when, one morning, he received the following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monmouth Crescent, Bayswater.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Sir,&mdash;Will you permit me to remind you, by means of this
      letter, of the notes of introduction presented recently by me to you, and
      written by our friends, &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      in America? My sister gives a <i>seance</i> to-morrow evening, and several
      notabilities of the scientific and literary world have promised to be
      present. If you will honour us with your company, I think you will be able
      to form a disinterested opinion on the importance of the new biology, as
      manifestations of an extraordinary kind are confidently expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;With kind regards, in which my sister joins, I am, most faithfully
      yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Salem Mapleleafe,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Solar Biologist&rsquo;.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;P.S.&mdash;The <i>séance</i> commences at five o&rsquo;clock, in this
      domicile.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley&rsquo;s first impulse was to throw the letter aside, and to write a curt
      but polite refusal. On reflection, however, he saw in the proposed séance
      a means of temporary distraction. Besides, the affair of the mysterious
      photograph had left him not a little curious as to the machinery used by
      the brother and sister&mdash;<i>arcades ambo</i>, or impostors both, he
      was certain&mdash;to gull an undiscerning public.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a little before five on the following evening, therefore, he presented
      himself at the door of the house in Monmouth Crescent, sent up his card,
      and was almost immediately shown into the drawing-room. To his surprise he
      found no one there, but he had scarcely glanced round the apartment when
      the door opened, and a slight sylph-like figure, clad in white, appeared
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a glance he recognised the face he had seen on the fading photograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you do, Mr. Bradley?&rsquo; said Eustasia, holding out a thin
      transparent hand, and fixing her light eyes upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I received your brother&rsquo;s invitation,&rsquo; he replied rather awkwardly. &lsquo;I am
      afraid I am a little before my time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;re the first to arrive. Salem&rsquo;s upstairs washing, and will be
      down directly. He&rsquo;s real pleased to know you&rsquo;ve come.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She flitted lightly across the room, and sat down close to the window. She
      looked white and worn, and all the life of her frame seemed concentrated
      in her extraordinary eyes, which she fixed upon the visitor with a
      steadiness calculated to discompose a timid man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down, Mr. Bradley?&rsquo; she said, repeating the name with a
      curious familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You seem to know me well,&rsquo; he replied, seating himself, &lsquo;though I do not
      think we have ever met.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, we have; leastways, I&rsquo;ve often heard you preach. I knew a man
      once in the States, who was the very image of <i>you</i>. He&rsquo;s dead now,
      he is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice, with its strong foreign inflexion, rang so strangely and
      plaintively on the last words, that Bradley was startled. He looked at the
      girl more closely, and was struck by her unearthly beauty, contrasting so
      oddly with her matter-of-fact, offhand manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your brother tells me that you are a sibyl,&rsquo; he said, drawing his chair
      nearer. &lsquo;I am afraid, Miss Mapleleafe, you will find me a disturbing
      influence. I have about as much faith in solar biology, spiritualism,
      spirit-agency, or whatever you like to call it, as I have in&mdash;well,
      Mumbo-Jumbo.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes still looked brightly into his, and her wan face was lit up with
      a curious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what they all say at first! Guess you think, then, that I&rsquo;m an
      impostor? Don&rsquo;t be afraid to speak your mind; I&rsquo;m used to it; I&rsquo;ve had
      worse than hard names thrown at me; stones and all that. I was stabbed
      once down South, and I&rsquo;ve the mark still!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she bared her white arm to the elbow, and showed, just in
      the fleshy part of the arm, the mark of an old scar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man that did that drew his knife in the dark, and pinioned my arm to
      the table. The very man that was like <i>you</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And lifting her arm to her lips she kissed the scar, and murmured, or
      crooned, to herself as she had done on the former occasion in the presence
      of her brother. Bradley looked on in amazement. So far as he could
      perceive at present, the woman was a half-mad creature, scarcely
      responsible for what she said or did.
    </p>
    <p>
      His embarrassment was not lessened when Eustasia, still holding the arm to
      her lips, looked at him through thickly gathering tears, and then, as if
      starting from a trance, gave vent to a wild yet musical laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely knowing what to say, he continued the former topic of
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I presume you are what is called a clairvoyante. That, of course, I can
      understand. But, do you really believe in supernatural manifestations?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the voice of the little Professor, who had quietly entered the room,
      supplied an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not, sir. The office of solar biology is not to vindicate, but
      to destroy, supernaturalism. <i>You</i> mean superhuman, which is quite
      another thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &lsquo;All things abide in Nature, nought subsists
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Beyond the infinite celestial scheme.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Motes in the sunbeam are the lives of men,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But in the moonlight and the stellar ray,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In every burning flame of every sphere,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Exist intelligible agencies
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Akin to thine and mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s how the great Bard puts it in a nutshell. Other lives in other
      worlds, sir, but no life out or beyond Nature, which embraces the solid
      universe to the remotest point in space.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Concluding with this flourish, Professor Mapleleafe dropped down into
      commonplace, wrung the visitor&rsquo;s hand, and wished him a very good-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you feel, Eustasia?&rsquo; he continued with some anxiety, addressing
      his sister. &lsquo;Do you feel as if the atmosphere this afternoon was properly
      conditioned?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Salem, I think so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor looked at his watch, and simultaneously there came a loud
      rapping at the door. Presently three persons entered, a tall,
      powerful-looking man, who was introduced as Doctor Kendall, and two
      elderly gentlemen; then a minute later, a little gray-haired man, the
      well-known Sir James Beaton, a famous physician of Edinburgh. The party
      was completed by the landlady of the house, who came up dressed in black
      silk, and wearing a widow&rsquo;s cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, then, ladies and gentlemen,&rsquo; said the little Professor glibly, &lsquo;we
      shall, with your permission, begin in the usual manner, by darkening the
      chamber and forming an ordinary circle. I warn you, however, that this is
      trivial, and in the manner of professional mediums. As the séance advances
      and the power deepens, we shall doubtless be lifted to higher ground.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying he drew the heavy curtains of the window, leaving the room in
      semi-darkness. Then the party sat down around a small circular table, and
      touched hands; Bradley sitting opposite Eustasia, who had Dr. Kendall on
      her right and Sir James Beaton on her left. The usual manifestations
      followed. The table rose bodily into the air, bells were rung, tiny
      sparkles of light flashed about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lasted about a quarter of an hour, at the end of which time
      Mapleleafe broke the circle, and drawing back a curtain, admitted some
      light into the room. It was then discovered that Eustasia, sitting in her
      place, with her hands resting upon the table, was in a state of mesmeric
      trance; and ghastly and sibylline indeed she looked, with her great eyes
      wide open, her golden hair fallen on her shoulders, her face shining as if
      mysteriously anointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eustasia!&rsquo; said the Professor softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl remained motionless, and did not seem to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eustasia!&rsquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time her lips moved, and a voice, that seemed shriller and clearer
      than her own, replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eustasia is not here. I am Sira.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is Sira?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A spirit of the third magnitude, from the region of the moon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A titter ran round the company, and Sir James Beaton essayed a feeble
      joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A lunar spirit&mdash;we shall not, I hope, be <i>de lunatico inquirendo</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, sir!&rsquo; cried the Professor; then he continued, addressing the medium
      his sister, &lsquo;Let me know if the conditions are perfect or imperfect?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot tell,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you see anything, Sira?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see faint forms floating on the sunbeam. They come and go, they change
      and fade. One is like a child, with its hand full of flowers. They are
      lilies&mdash;O, I can see no more. I am blind. There is too much light.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor drew the curtain, darkening the chamber. He then sat down in
      his place at the table, and requested all present to touch hands once
      more. So far, Bradley had looked on with impatience, not unmingled with
      disgust. What he saw and heard was exactly what he had heard described a
      hundred times.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the darkening of the room, the manifestations recommenced. The table
      moved about like a thing possessed, the very floor seemed to tremble and
      upheave, the bells rang, the lights flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all at once Bradley became aware of a strange sound, as if the whole
      room were full of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep still!&rsquo; said the Professor. &lsquo;Do not break the chain. Wait!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A long silence followed; then the strange sound was heard again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you there, my friend?&rsquo; asked the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are the conditions right?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was answered by a cry from the medium, so wild and strange that all
      present were startled and awed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See! see!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it Sira?&rsquo; demanded the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shapes like angels, carrying one that looks like a corpse. They are
      singing&mdash;do you not hear them? Now they are touching me&mdash;they
      are passing their hands over my hair. I see my mother; she is weeping and
      bending over me. Mother! mother!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously, Bradley himself appeared conscious of glimpses like human
      faces flashing and fading. In spite of his scepticism, a deep dread, which
      was shared more or less by all present, fell upon him. Then all at once he
      became aware of something like a living form, clad in robes of dazzling
      whiteness, passing by him. An icy cold hand was pressed to his forehead,
      leaving a clammy damp like dew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see a shape of some kind,&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Does anyone else perceive it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes! yes! yes!&rsquo; came from several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the spirit of a woman,&rsquo; murmured the medium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know her?&rsquo; added the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; she belongs to the living world, not to the dead. I see far away,
      somewhere on this planet, a beautiful lady lying asleep; she seems full of
      sorrow, her pillow is wet with tears. This is the lady&rsquo;s spirit, brought
      hither by the magnetic influence of one she loves.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you describe her to us more closely?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. She has dark hair, and splendid dark eyes; she is tall and lovely.
      The lady and the spirit are alike, the counterpart of each other.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more Bradley was conscious of the white form standing near him; he
      reached out his hands to touch it, but it immediately vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment he felt a touch like breath upon his face, and heard a
      soft musical voice murmuring in his ear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ambrose! beloved!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He started in wonder, for the voice seemed that of Alma Craik.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be good enough not to break the chain!&rsquo; said the landlady, who occupied
      the chair at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trembling violently, he returned his hands to their place, touching those
      of his immediate neighbours on either side. The instant he did so, he
      heard the voice again, and felt the touch like breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ambrose, do you know me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is speaking?&rsquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand soft as velvet and cold as ice was passed over his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is I, dearest!&rsquo; said the voice. &lsquo;It is <i>Alma!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What brings you here?&rsquo; he murmured, almost inaudibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew you were in sorrow;&mdash;I came to bring you comfort, and to
      assure you of my affection.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were spoken in a low, just audible voice, close to his ear, and
      it is doubtful if they were heard by any other member of the company. In
      the meantime the more commonplace manifestations still continued; the room
      was full of strange sounds, bells ringing, knocking, shuffling of
      invisible feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley was startled beyond measure. Either her supernatural presence was
      close by him, or he was the victim of some cruel trick. Before he could
      speak again, he felt the pressure of cold lips on his forehead, and the
      same strange voice murmuring farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wild with excitement, not unmingled with suspicion, he again broke the
      chain and sprang to his feet. There was a sharp cry from the medium, as he
      sprang to the window and drew back the curtain, letting in the daylight.
      But the act discovered nothing. All the members of the circle, save
      himself, were sitting in their places. Eustasia, the medium, was calmly
      leaning back in her chair. In a moment, however, she started, put her hand
      quickly to her forehead as if in pain, and seemed to emerge from her
      trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Salem,&rsquo; she cried in her own natural voice, &lsquo;has anything happened?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Bradley has broken the conditions, that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; returned the
      Professor, with an air of offended dignity. &lsquo;I do protest, ladies and
      gentlemen, against that interruption. It has brought a most interesting
      seance to a violent close.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general murmur from the company, and dissatisfied glances were
      cast at the offender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry,&rsquo; said the clergyman. &lsquo;I yielded to an irresistible
      influence.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The spirits won&rsquo;t be trifled with, sir,&rsquo; cried Mapleleafe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; said one of the elderly gentlemen. &lsquo;Solemn mysteries like
      these should be approached in a fair and a&mdash;hum&mdash;a respectful
      spirit. For my own part, I am quite satisfied with what I have seen. It
      convinces me of&mdash;hum&mdash;the reality of these phenomena.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other elderly gentleman concurred. Dr. Kendall and Sir James, who had
      been comparing notes, said that they would reserve their final judgment
      until they had been present at another seance. In the mean time they would
      go so far as to say that what they had witnessed was very extraordinary
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are you now, Eustasia?&rsquo; said the Professor, addressing his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My head aches. I feel as if I had been standing for hours in a burning
      sun. When you called me back I was dreaming so strangely. I thought I was
      in some celestial place, walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley looked at the speaker&rsquo;s face. It looked full of elfin or
      witch-like rather than angelic light. Their eyes met, and Eustasia gave a
      curious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you come again, Mr. Bradley?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps; that is to say, if you will permit me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do think, sir,&rsquo; interrupted the Professor, &lsquo;that you have given offence
      to the celestial intelligences, and I am not inclined to admit you to our
      circle again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Several voices murmured approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are wrong, brother,&rsquo; cried Eustasia, &lsquo;you are quite wrong.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean, Eustasia?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean that Mr. Bradley is a medium himself, and a particular favourite
      with spirits of the first order.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor seemed to reflect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s so (and <i>you</i> ought to know), it&rsquo;s another matter.
      But he&rsquo;ll have to promise not to break the conditions. It ain&rsquo;t fair to
      the spirits; it ain&rsquo;t fair to his fellow-inquirers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the company departed, but Bradley still lingered, as if he had
      something still to hear or say. At last, when the last visitor had gone,
      and the landlady had grimly stalked away to continue her duties in the
      basement of the house, he found himself alone with the brother and sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood hesitating, hat in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I ask you a few questions?&rsquo; he said, addressing Eustasia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, certainly,&rsquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;While you were in the state of trance did you see or hear anything that
      took place in this room?&rsquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustasia shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know anything whatever of my private life?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I guess not, except what I&rsquo;ve read in the papers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know a lady named Craik, who is one of the members of my
      congregation?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer came in another shake of the head, and a blank look expressing
      entire ignorance. Either Eustasia knew nothing whatever, or she was a most
      accomplished actress. Puzzled and amazed, yet still suspecting fraud of
      some kind, Bradley took his leave.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he few days
      following the one on which the spiritualistic <i>séance</i> was held were
      passed by Bradley in a sort of dream. The more he thought of what he had
      heard and seen, the more puzzled he became. At times he seemed half
      inclined to believe in supernatural collaboration, then he flouted his
      belief and laughed contemptuously at himself. Of course it was all
      imposture, and he had been a dupe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he thought of Eustasia, and the interest which she had at first
      aroused in him rapidly changed to indignation and contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon these people ceased to occupy his thoughts at all; so
      self-absorbed was he, indeed, in his own trouble that he forgot them as
      completely as if they had never been. After all they were but shadows
      which had flitted across his path and faded. Had he been left to himself
      he would assuredly never have summoned them up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was evidently too valuable a convert to be let go in that way. One
      morning he received the following note, written on delicate paper in the
      most fairylike of fragile hands:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Mr. Bradley,&mdash;We hold a <i>séance</i> to-morrow night at
      six, and hope you&rsquo;ll come; at least, <i>I</i> do! Salem don&rsquo;t particularly
      want you, since you broke the conditions, and he regards you as a
      disturbing influence. I <i>know better</i>: the spirits like you, and I
      feel that with you I could do great things; so I hope you&rsquo;ll be here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eustasia Mapleleafe.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley read the letter through twice, then he gazed at it for a time in
      trembling hesitation. Should he go? Why not? Suppose the people were
      humbugs, were they worse than dozens of others he had met? and they had at
      least the merit of bringing back to him the presence of the one being who
      was all in all to him. His hesitation lasted only for a moment&mdash;the
      repulsion came. He threw the letter aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      À few days later a much more significant incident occurred. As Bradley was
      leaving his house one morning he came face to face with a veiled woman who
      stood before his door. He was about to pass: the lady laid a retaining
      hand upon his arm and raised her veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Eustasia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Guess you&rsquo;re surprised to see me,&rsquo; she said, noticing his start; &lsquo;suppose
      I may come in, though, now I&rsquo;m here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley pushed open the door, and led the way to his study. Eustasia
      followed him; having reached the room, she sat down and eyed him
      wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you get my letter?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t answer it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you want me to tell you?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, certainly&mdash;else why do I ask you? but I see you don&rsquo;t wish to
      tell me. Why?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I dislike giving unnecessary pain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! in other words you believe me to be a humbug, but you haven&rsquo;t the
      cruelty to say so. Well, that don&rsquo;t trouble me. <i>Prove</i> me to be one,
      and you may call me one, but give me a fair trial first.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come to some more of our <i>séances</i>, will you? <i>do</i> say you&rsquo;ll
      come!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand gently upon his arm, and fixed her eyes almost
      entreatingly upon him. He stared at her like one fascinated, then shrank
      before her glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you wish me to come?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know my thoughts and feelings on this subject. You and I are cast in
      different moulds; we must go different ways.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The spirits will it otherwise,&rsquo; she said; while under her breath she
      added, &lsquo;and so do I.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was in no mood to yield that day. As soon as Eustasia saw this she
      rose to go. When her thin hand lay in his, she said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Bradley, if ever you are in trouble come to <i>us</i>; you will find
      it is not all humbug <i>then!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustasia returned home full of hope. &lsquo;He will come,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;yes, he
      will assuredly come.&rsquo; But days passed, and he neither came nor sent; at
      last, growing impatient, she called again at his house; then she learned
      that he had left London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has flown from me,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;he feels my influence, and fears
      it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this Eustasia was quite wrong. He was flying not from her but from
      himself. The wretched life of self-reproach and misery which he was
      compelled to lead was crushing him down so utterly that unless he made
      some effort he would sink and sicken. Die? Well, after all, that would not
      have been so hard; but the thought of leaving Alma was more than he could
      bear. He must live for the sake of the days which might yet be in store
      for them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      He needed change, however, and he sought it for a few days on foreign
      soil. He went over one morning to Boulogne, took rooms in the Hôtel de
      Paris, and became one of the swarm of tourists which was there filling the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bathing season was then at its height, and people were all too busy to
      notice him; he walked about like one in a dream, watching the
      pleasure-seekers, but pondering for ever on the old theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all it was well for him that he had left England, he thought&mdash;the
      busy garrulous life of this place came as a relief after the dreary
      monotony of town. In the evenings he strolled out to the concerts or
      open-air dances, and observed the fisher girls, with their lovers moving
      about in the gaslight; while in the mornings he strolled about the sand
      watching with listless amusement the bathers who crowded down to the
      water&rsquo;s edge like bees in swarming time.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, feeling more sick at heart than usual, he issued from the
      hotel and bent his steps towards the strand. On that day the scene was
      unusually animated. Flocks of fantastically-dressed children amused
      themselves by making houses in the sand, while their <i>bonnes</i> watched
      over them, and their mammas, clad in equally fantastic costumes, besieged
      the bathing-machines. Bradley walked for a time on the sands watching the
      variegated crowd; it was amusing and distracting, and he was about to look
      around for a quiet spot in which he could spend an hour or so, when he was
      suddenly startled by an apparition.
    </p>
    <p>
      A party of three were making their way towards the bathing-machines, and
      were even then within a few yards of him. One was a child dressed in a
      showy costume of serge, with long curls falling upon his shoulders; on one
      side of him was a French <i>bonne</i>, on the other a lady extravagantly
      attired in the most gorgeous of sea-side costumes. Her cheeks and lips
      were painted a bright red, but her skin was white as alabaster. She was
      laughing heartily at something which the little boy had said, when
      suddenly her eyes fell upon Bradley, who stood now within two yards of
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not pause nor shrink, but she ceased laughing, and a peculiar look
      of thinly veiled contempt passed over her face as she walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Maman</i>,&rsquo; said the child in French, &lsquo;who is that man, and why did he
      stare so at you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady shrugged her shoulders, and laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He stared because he had nothing better to look at, I suppose, <i>chéri</i>;
      but come, I shall miss my bath; you had best stay here with Augustine, and
      make sand-hills till I rejoin you. <i>Au revoir</i>, Bébé.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She left the child with the nurse, hastened on and entered one of the
      bathing-machines, which was immediately drawn down into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley still stood where she had left him, and his eyes remained fixed
      upon the machine which held the woman whose very presence poisoned the air
      he breathed. All his old feelings of repulsion returned tenfold; the very
      sight of the woman seemed to degrade and drag him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood there the door of the machine opened, and she came forth
      again. This time she was the wonder of all. Her shapely limbs were partly
      naked, and her body was covered with a quaintly cut bathing-dress of red.
      She called out some instructions to her nurse; then she walked down and
      entered the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley turned and walked away. He passed up the strand and sat down
      listlessly on one of the seats on the terrace facing the water. He took
      out Alma&rsquo;s last letter, and read it through, and the bitterness of his
      soul increased tenfold.
    </p>
    <p>
      When would his misery end? he thought. Why did not death come and claim
      his own, and leave him free? Wherever he went his existence was poisoned
      by this miserable woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it must ever be,&rsquo; he said bitterly. &lsquo;I must leave this place, for the
      very sight of her almost drives me mad.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and was about to move away, when he became conscious, for the
      first time, that something unusual was taking place. He heard sounds of
      crying and moaning, and everybody seemed to be rushing excitedly towards
      the sand. What it was all about Bradley could not understand, for he could
      see nothing. He stood and watched; every moment the cries grew louder, and
      the crowd upon the sands increased. He seized upon a passing Frenchman,
      and asked what the commotion meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Ras de marée, monsieur!</i>&rsquo; rapidly explained the man as he rushed
      onward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoroughly mystified now, Bradley resolved to discover by personal
      inspection what it all meant. Leaving the terrace he leapt upon the shore,
      and gained the waiting crowd upon the sand. To get an explanation from
      anyone here seemed to be impossible, for every individual member of the
      crowd seemed to have gone crazy. The women threw up their bands and
      moaned, the children screamed, while the men rushed half wildly about the
      sands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley touched the arm of a passing Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is all this panic about?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The <i>ras de marée!</i>&rsquo; r Yes, but what is the ras de marée?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know? It is a sudden rising of the tide; it comes only once in
      three years. It has surprised the bathers, many of whom are drowning. See,
      several machines have gone to pieces, and the others are floating like
      driftwood! Yonder are two boats out picking up the people, but if the
      waves continue to rise like this they will never save them all. One woman
      from that boat has fainted; no, good heavens, she is dead.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene now became one of intense excitement. The water, rising higher
      and higher, was breaking now into waves of foam; most of the machines were
      dashed about like corks upon the ocean, their frightened occupants giving
      forth the most fearful shrieks and cries. Suddenly there was a cry for the
      lifeboat; immediately after it dashed down the sand, drawn by two horses,
      and was launched out upon the sea; while Bradley and others occupied
      themselves in attending to those who were laid fainting upon the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boats, rapidly as they went to work, proved insufficient to save
      the mass of frightened humanity still struggling with the waves. The
      screams and cries became heartrending as one after another sank to rise no
      more. Suddenly there was another rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave the women to attend to the rescued,&rsquo; cried several voices. &lsquo;Let the
      men swim out to the rescue of those who are exhausted in the sea.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rush to the water; among the first was Bradley, who, throwing
      off his coat, plunged boldly into the water. Many of those who followed
      him were soon overcome by the force of the waves and driven back to shore;
      but Bradley was a powerful swimmer, and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made straight for a figure which, seemingly overlooked by everyone
      else, was drifting rapidly out to sea. On coming nearer he saw, by the
      long black hair, which floated around her on the water, that the figure
      was that of a woman. How she supported herself Bradley could not see; she
      was neither swimming nor floating; her back was towards him, and she might
      have fainted, for she made no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      On coming nearer he saw that she was supporting herself by means of a
      plank, part of the <i>debris</i> which had drifted from the broken
      machines. By this time he was quite near to her;&mdash;she turned her face
      towards him, and he almost cried out in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recognised his wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there she was, helpless and almost fainting&mdash;her eyes were
      heavy, her lips blue; and he seemed to be looking straight into the face
      of death. Bradley paused, and the two gazed into each other&rsquo;s eyes. He saw
      that her strength was going, but he made no attempt to put out a hand to
      save her. He thought of the past, of the curse this woman had been to him;
      and he knew that by merely doing nothing she would be taken from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should he let her die? Why not? If he had not swum out she most assuredly
      would have sunk and been heard of no more. Again he looked at her and she
      looked at him: her eyes were almost closed now: having once looked into
      his face she seemed to have resigned all hopes of rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, he could not save her&mdash;the temptation was too great. He turned
      and swam in the direction of another figure which was floating helplessly
      upon the waves. He had only taken three strokes when a violent revulsion
      of feeling came; with a terrible cry he turned again to the spot where he
      had left the fainting and drowning woman. But she was not there&mdash;the
      plank was floating upon the water&mdash;that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley dived, and reappeared holding the woman in his arms. Then he
      struck out with her to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a matter of some difficulty to get there, for she lay like lead in
      his hold. Having reached the shore, he carried her up the beach, and
      placed her upon the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he looked to see if she was conscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she still breathed;&mdash;he gave her some brandy, and did all in his
      power to restore her to life. After a while she opened her eyes, and
      looked into Bradley&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, it is <i>you!</i> she murmured faintly, then, with a long-drawn sigh,
      she sank back, dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      Still dripping from his encounter with the sea, his face as white as the
      dead face before him, Bradley stood like one turned to stone. Suddenly he
      was aroused by a heartrending shriek. The little boy whom he had seen with
      the dead woman broke from the bauds of his nurse, and sobbing violently
      threw himself upon the dead body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Maman! maman!</i>&rsquo; he moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The helpless cries of the child forced upon Bradley the necessity for
      immediate action. Having learned from the nurse the address of the house
      where &lsquo;Mrs. Montmorency&rsquo; was staying, he had the body put upon a stretcher
      and conveyed there. He himself walked beside it, and the child followed,
      screaming and crying, in his nurse&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having reached the house, the body was taken into a room to be properly
      dressed, while Bradley tried every means in his power to console the
      child! After a while he was told that all was done, and he went into the
      chamber of death.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t would have been
      difficult to analyse accurately the emotions which filled the bosom of
      Ambrose Bradley, as he stood and looked upon the dead face of the woman
      who, according to the law of the land and the sacrament of the Church, had
      justly claimed to be his wife. He could not conceal from himself that the
      knowledge of her death brought relief to him and even joy; but mingled
      with that relief were other feelings less reassuring&mdash;pity, remorse
      even, and a strange sense of humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never really loved the woman, and her conduct, previous to their
      long separation, had been such as to kill all sympathy in the heart of a
      less sensitive man, while what might be termed her unexpected resurrection
      had roused in him a bitterness and a loathing beyond expression. Yet now
      that the last word was said, the last atonement made, now that he beheld
      the eyes that would never open again, and the lips that would never again
      utter speech or sound, his soul was stirred to infinite compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, he thought, the blame had not been hers that they had been so
      ill-suited to each other, and afterwards, when they met in after years,
      she had not wilfully sought to destroy his peace. It had all been a cruel
      fatality, from the first: another proof of the pitiless laws which govern
      human nature, and make men and women suffer as sorely for errors of
      ignorance and inexperience as for crimes of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knelt by the bedside, and taking her cold hand kissed it solemnly.
      Peace was between them, he thought, then and for ever. <i>She</i> too,
      with all her faults and all her follies, had been a fellow-pilgrim by his
      side towards the great bourne whence no pilgrim returns, and she had
      reached it first. He remembered now, not the woman who had flaunted her
      shamelessness before his eyes, but the pretty girl, almost a child, whom
      he had first known and fancied that he loved. In the intensity of his
      compassion and self-reproach he even exaggerated the tenderness he had
      once felt for her; the ignoble episode of their first intercourse catching
      a sad brightness reflected from the heavens of death. And in this mood,
      penitent and pitying, he prayed that God might forgive them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he descended from the room, his eyes were red with tears. He found
      the little boy sobbing wildly in the room below, attended by the kindly
      Frenchwoman who kept the house. He tried to soothe him, but found it
      impossible, his grief being most painful to witness, and violent in the
      extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, monsieur, it is indeed a calamity!&rsquo; cried the woman. &lsquo;Madame was so
      good a mother, devoted to her child. But God is good&mdash;the little one
      has a father still!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley understood the meaning of her words, but did not attempt to
      undeceive her. His heart was welling over with tenderness towards the
      pretty orphan, and he was thinking too of his own harsh judgments on the
      dead, who, it was clear, had possessed many redeeming virtues, not the
      least of them being her attachment to her boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are right, madame,&rsquo; he replied, sadly, &lsquo;and the little one shall not
      lack fatherly love and care. Will you come with me for a few moments? I
      wish to speak to you alone.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed his hand tenderly on the child&rsquo;s head, and again tried to soothe
      him, but he shrank away with petulant screams and cries. Walking to the
      front entrance he waited till he was joined there by the landlady, and
      they stood talking in the open air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long had she been here, madame?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For a month, monsieur,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;She came late in the season for
      the baths, with her <i>bonne</i> and the little boy, and took my rooms.
      Pardon, but I did not know madame had a husband living, and so near.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have been separated for many years. I came to Boulogne yesterday quite
      by accident, not dreaming the lady was here. Can you tell me if she has
      friends in Boulogne?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not think so, monsieur. She lived quite alone, seeing no one, and
      her only thought and care was for the little boy. She was a proud lady,
      very rich and proud; nothing was too good for her, or for the child; she
      lived, as the saying is, <i>en princesse</i>. But no, she had no friends!
      Doubtless, being an English lady, though she spoke and looked like a <i>compatriote</i>,
      all her friends were in her own land.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; returned Bradley, turning his head away to hide his tears; for
      he thought to himself, &lsquo;Poor Mary! After all, she was desolate like
      myself! How pitiful that I, of all men, should close her eyes and follow
      her to her last repose!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon, monsieur,&rsquo; said the woman, &lsquo;but madame, perhaps, was not of our
      Church? She was, no doubt, Protestant?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a simple question, but simple as it was Bradley was startled by it.
      He knew about as much of his dead wife&rsquo;s professed belief as of the source
      whence she had drawn her subsistence. But he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, certainly. Protestant, of course.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then monsieur will speak to the English clergyman, who dwells there on
      the hill&rsquo; (here she pointed townward), &lsquo;close to the English church. He is
      a good man, Monsieur Robertson, and monsieur will find&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will speak to him,&rsquo; interrupted Bradley. &lsquo;But I myself am an English
      clergyman, and shall doubtless perform the last offices, when the time
      comes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked at him in some astonishment, for his presence was the
      reverse of clerical, and his struggle in and with the sea had left his
      attire in most admired disorder, but she remembered the eccentricities of
      the nation to which he belonged, and her wonder abated. After giving the
      woman a few more general instructions, Bradley walked slowly and
      thoughtfully to his hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once already his thoughts had turned towards Alma, but he had
      checked such thoughts and crushed them down in the presence of death; left
      to himself, however, he could not conquer them, nor restrain a certain
      feeling of satisfaction in his newly-found freedom. He would write to
      Alma, as in duty bound, at once, and tell her of all that had happened.
      And then? It was too late, perhaps, to make full amends, to expect full
      forgiveness; but it was his duty to give to her in the sight of the world
      the name he had once given to her secretly and in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man&rsquo;s troubled spirit, sensitive to a degree, shrank from the idea
      of building up any new happiness on the grave of the poor woman whose
      corpse he had just quitted. Although he was now a free man legally, he
      still felt morally bound and fettered. All his wish and prayer was to
      atone for the evil he had brought on the one being he reverenced and
      loved. He did not dare, at least as yet, to think of uniting his unworthy
      life with a life so infinitely more beautiful and pure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he would write to her. The question was, where his letter would find
      her, and how soon?
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had last heard from her she was at Milan, but that was several
      weeks ago; and since then, though he had written twice, there had been no
      response. She was possibly travelling farther southward; in all
      possibility, to Home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next few days passed drearily enough. An examination of some letters
      recently received by the deceased discovered two facts&mdash;first, that
      she had a sister, living in Oxford, with whom she corresponded; and,
      second, that her means of subsistence came quarterly from a firm of
      solicitors in Bedford Bow, London. Next day the sister arrived by
      steamboat, accompanied by her husband, a small tradesman. Bradley
      interviewed the pair, and found them decent people, well acquainted with
      their relative&rsquo;s real position. The same day he received a communication
      from the solicitors, notifying that the annuity enjoyed by &lsquo;Mrs.
      Montmorency&rsquo; lapsed with her decease, but that a large sum of money had
      been settled by the late Lord Ombermere upon the child, the interest of
      the sum to be used for his maintenance and education, and the gross amount
      with additions and under certain reservations, to be at his disposal on
      attaining his majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeking an interview with the Rev. Mr. Robertson, the minister of the
      English Church, Bradley soon found that his reputation had preceded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do I address the famous Mr. Bradley, who some time ago seceded from the
      English Church?&rsquo; asked the minister, a pale, elderly, clean-shaven man,
      bearing no little resemblance to a Roman Catholic priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley nodded, and at once saw the not too cordial manner of the other
      sink to freezing point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The unfortunate lady was your wife?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; but we had been separated for many years.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, indeed!&rsquo; sighed the clergyman with a long-drawn sigh, a furtive
      glance of repulsion, and an inward exclamation of &lsquo;no wonder!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Although we lived apart, and although, to be frank, there was great
      misunderstanding between us, all that is over for ever, you understand. It
      is in a spirit of the greatest tenderness and compassion that I wish to
      conduct the funeral service&mdash;to which I presume there is no
      objection.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robertson started in amazement, as if a bomb had exploded under his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To conduct the funeral service! But you have seceded from the Church of
      England.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a sense, yes; but I have never done so formally. I am still an English
      clergyman.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could never consent to such a thing,&rsquo; cried the other, indignantly. &lsquo;I
      should look upon it as profanity. Your published opinions are known to me,
      sir; they have shocked me inexpressibly; and not only in my opinion, but
      in that of my spiritual superiors, they are utterly unworthy of one
      calling himself a Christian.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you refuse me permission to officiate?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most emphatically. More than that, I shall require some assurance that
      the lady did not share your heresies, before I will suffer the interment
      to take place in the precincts of my church.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is not my assurance sufficient?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir, it is <i>not!</i>&rsquo; exclaimed the clergyman with scornful
      dignity. &lsquo;I do not wish to say anything offensive, but, speaking as a
      Christian and a pastor of the English Church, I can attach no weight
      whatever to the assurances of one who is, in the public estimation,
      nothing better than an avowed infidel. Good morning!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, with a last withering look, the clergyman turned on his heel
      and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that remonstrance was useless, and might even cause public scandal,
      Bradley forthwith abandoned his design; but at his suggestion his wife&rsquo;s
      sister saw the incumbent, and succeeded in convincing him that Mrs.
      Montmorency had died in the true faith. The result of Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s
      pious indignation was soon apparent. The sister and her husband, who had
      hitherto treated Bradley with marked respect, now regarded him with sullen
      dislike and suspicion. They could not prevent him, however, from following
      as chief mourner, when the day of the funeral came.
    </p>
    <p>
      That funeral was a dismal enough experience for Ambrose Bradley. Never
      before had he felt so keenly the vanity of his own creed and the isolation
      of his own opinions, as when he stood by the graveside and listened to the
      last solemn words of the English burial service. He seemed like a black
      shadow in the sacred place. The words of promise and resurrection had
      little meaning for one who had come to regard the promise as only
      beautiful &lsquo;poetry,&rsquo; and the resurrection as only a poet&rsquo;s dream. And
      though the sense of his own sin lay on his heart like lead, he saw no
      benign Presence blessing the miserable woman who had departed, upraising
      her on wings of gladness; all he perceived was Death&rsquo;s infinite
      desolation, and the blackness of that open grave.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>radley&rsquo;s first
      impulse, on quitting Boulogne, was to hasten at once on to Italy, seek out
      Alma, and tell her all that had occurred; but that impulse was no sooner
      felt than it was conquered. The man had a quickening conscience left, and
      he could not have stood just then before the woman he loved without the
      bitterest pain and humiliation. No, he would write to her, he would break
      the news gently by letter, not by word of mouth; and afterwards, perhaps,
      when his sense of spiritual agony had somewhat worn away, he would go to
      her and throw himself upon her tender mercy. So instead of flying on to
      Italy he returned by the mail to London, and thence wrote at length to
      Alma, giving her full details of his wife&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the man was so broken in spirit and so changed in body, that
      even his worst enemies might have pitied him. The trouble of the last few
      months had stript him of all his intellectual pride, and left him
      supremely sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, as ever, the mind of the man, though its light was clouded,
      turned in the direction of celestial or supermundane things. Readers who
      are differently constituted, and who regard such speculations as trivial
      or irrelevant, will doubtless have some difficulty in comprehending an
      individual who, through all vicissitudes of moral experience, invariably
      returned to the one set purpose of spiritual inquiry. To him one thing was
      paramount, even over all his own sorrows&mdash;the solution of the great
      problem of human life and immortality. This was his haunting idea, his
      monomania, so to speak. Just as a physiologist would examine his own blood
      under the microscope, just as a scientific inquirer would sacrifice his
      own life and happiness for the verification of a theory, so would Bradley
      ask himself, even when on the rack of moral torment, How far does this
      suffering help me to a solution of the mystery of life?
    </p>
    <p>
      True, for a time he had been indifferent, even callous, drifting, on the
      vague current of agnosticism, he knew not whither; but that did not last
      for long: the very constitution of Bradley saved him from that
      indifferentness which is the chronic disease of so many modern men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Infinitely tender of heart, he had been moved to the depths by his recent
      experience; he had felt, as all of us at some time feel, the sanctifying
      and purifying power of Death. A mean man would have exulted in the new
      freedom Death had brought; Bradley, on the other hand, stood stupefied and
      aghast at his own liberation. On a point of conscience he could have
      fought with, and perhaps conquered, all the prejudices of society; but
      when his very conscience turned against him he was paralysed with doubt,
      wonder, and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to London, and there awaited Alma&rsquo;s answer. One day, urged by
      a sudden impulse, he bent his steps towards the mysterious house in
      Bayswater, and found Eustasia Mapleleafe sitting alone. Never had the
      little lady looked so strange and <i>spirituelle.</i> Her elfin-like face
      looked pale and worn, and her great wistful eyes were surrounded with dark
      melancholy rings. But she looked up as he entered, with her old smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew you would come,&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;I was thinking of you, and I felt the
      celestial agencies were going to bring us together. And I&rsquo;m real glad to
      see you before we go away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are leaving London?&rsquo; asked Bradley, as he seated himself close to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Salem talks of going back home before winter sets in and the fogs
      begin. I don&rsquo;t seem able to breathe right in this air. If I stopped here
      long, I think I should die.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she passed her thin transparent hand across her forehead,
      with a curious gesture of pain. As Bradley looked at her steadfastly she
      averted his gaze, and a faint hectic flush came into her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Guess you think it don&rsquo;t matter much,&rsquo; she continued with the sharp
      nervous laugh peculiar to her, &lsquo;whether I live or die. Well, Mr. Bradley,
      I suppose you&rsquo;re right, and I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t care much how soon I go.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very young to talk like that,&rsquo; said Bradley gently; &lsquo;but perhaps
      I misunderstand you, and you mean that you would gladly exchange this life
      for freer activity and larger happiness in another?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustasia laughed again, but this time she looked full into her
      questioner&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;What I mean is that I am
      downright tired, and should just like a good long spell of sleep.&rsquo; &lsquo;But
      surely, if your belief is true, you look for something more than that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I do. You mean I want to join the spirits, and go wandering
      about from one planet to another, or coming down to earth and making
      people uncomfortable? That seems a <i>stupid</i> sort of life, doesn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;about
      as stupid as this one? I&rsquo;d rather tuck my head under my wing, like a
      little bird, and go to sleep for ever!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley opened his eyes, amazed and a little disconcerted by the lady&rsquo;s
      candour. Before he could make any reply she continued, in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, I&rsquo;ve got no one in the world to care for me, except Salem, my
      brother. He&rsquo;s good to me, he is, but that doesn&rsquo;t make up for everything.
      I don&rsquo;t feel like a girl, but like an old woman. I&rsquo;d rather be one of
      those foolish creatures you meet everywhere, who think of nothing but
      millinery and flirtation, than what I am. That&rsquo;s all the good the spirits
      have done me, to spoil my good looks and make me old before my time. I
      hate them sometimes; I hate myself for listening to them, and I say what I
      said before&mdash;that if I&rsquo;m to live on as <i>they</i> do, and go on in
      the same curious way, I&rsquo;d sooner die!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you would be quite honest with me,&rsquo; said Bradley, after a brief
      pause. &lsquo;I see you are ill, and I am sure you are unhappy. Suppose much of
      your illness, and all your unhappiness, came from your acquiescence in a
      scheme of folly and self-deception? You already know my opinion on these
      matters to which you allude. If I may speak quite frankly, I have always
      suspected you and your brother&mdash;but your brother more than you&mdash;of
      a conspiracy to deceive the public; and if I were not otherwise interested
      in you, if I did not feel for you the utmost sympathy and compassion, I
      should pass the matter by without a word. As it is, I would give a great
      deal if I could penetrate into the true motives of your conduct, and
      ascertain how far you are self-deluded.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rsquo; answered Eustasia, shaking her head sadly. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t explain
      it all even to myself; impossible to explain to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But do you seriously and verily believe in the truth of these so-called
      spiritual manifestations?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Guess I do,&rsquo; returned the lady, with a decided nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You believe in them, even while you admit their stupidity, their
      absurdity?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you ask me, I think life is a foolish business altogether. That&rsquo;s why
      I&rsquo;d like to be done with it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But surely if spiritualism were an accepted fact, it would offer a
      solution of all the mysterious phenomena of human existence? It would
      demonstrate, at all events, that our experience does not cease with the
      body, which limits its area so much.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustasia sighed wearily, and folding her thin hands on her knee, looked
      wearily at the fire, which flickered faintly in the grate. With all her
      candour of speech, she still presented to her interlocutor an expression
      of mysterious evasiveness. Nor was there any depth in her complaining
      sorrow. It seemed rather petulant and shallow than really solemn and
      profound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t talk about it,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Talk to me about yourself,
      Mr. Bradley. You&rsquo;ve been in trouble, I know; <i>they</i> told me. I&rsquo;ve
      liked you ever since I first saw you, and I wish I could give you some
      help.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Bradley been a different kind of man, he would scarcely have
      misunderstood the look she gave him then, full as it was of passionate
      admiration which she took no care to veil. Bending towards him, and
      looking into his eyes, she placed her hand on his; and the warm touch of
      the tremulous fingers went through him with a curious thrill. Nor did she
      withdraw the hand as she continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve only seen one man in the world like <i>you</i>. He&rsquo;s dead, he is.
      But you&rsquo;re his image. I told Salem so the day I first saw you. Some folks
      say that souls pass from one body into another, and I almost believe it
      when I think of him and look at <i>you</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, with tears in her eyes and a higher flush on her cheek,
      there was a footstep in the room, and looking up she saw her brother, who
      had entered unperceived. His appearance was fortunate, as it perhaps saved
      her from some further indiscretions. Bradley, who had been too absorbed in
      the thoughts awakened by her first question to notice the peculiarity of
      her manner, held out his hand to the new-comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Glad to see you again,&rsquo; said the Professor. &lsquo;I suppose Eustasia has told
      you that we&rsquo;re going back to the States? I calculate we haven&rsquo;t done much
      good by sailing over. The people of England are a whole age behind the
      Americans, and won&rsquo;t be ripe for our teaching till many a year has
      passed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When do you leave London?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In eight days. We&rsquo;re going to take passage in the &ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; which sails
      to-morrow week.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you will give no more <i>séances?</i> I am sorry, for I should have
      liked to come again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustasia started, and looked eagerly at her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you come <i>to-night?</i>&rsquo; she asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-night!&rsquo; echoed Bradley. &lsquo;Is a <i>séance</i> to be held?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; interrupted Mapleleafe. &lsquo;But yes,&rsquo; added Eustasia. &lsquo;We shall be
      alone, but that will be all the better. I should not like to leave England
      without convincing Mr. Bradley that there is something in your solar
      biology after all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll waste your time, Eustasia,&rsquo; remarked the Professor drily. &lsquo;You
      know what the poet says?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A man convinced against his will
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Is of the same opinion still.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And I guess you&rsquo;ll never convert Mr. Bradley.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try, at any rate,&rsquo; returned Eustasia, smiling; then turning to the
      clergyman with an eager wistful look, she added, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll come, won&rsquo;t you?
      To-night at seven.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley promised, and immediately afterwards took his leave. He had not
      exaggerated in expressing his regret at the departure of the curious pair;
      for since his strange experience at Boulogne he was intellectually
      unstrung, and eager to receive spiritual impressions, even from a quarter
      which he distrusted. He unconsciously felt, too, the indescribable
      fascination which Eustasia, more than most women, knew how to exert on
      highly organised persons of the opposite sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, the brother and sister looked at each other for some moments
      in silence; then the Professor exclaimed half angrily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll kill yourself, Eustasia, that&rsquo;s what <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> do! I&rsquo;ve
      foreseen it all along, just as I foresaw it when you first met Ulysses S.
      Stedman. You&rsquo;re clean gone on this man, and if I wasn&rsquo;t ready to protect
      you, Lord knows you&rsquo;d make a fool of yourself again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustasia looked up in his face and laughed. It was curious to note her
      change of look and manner; her face was still pale and elfin-like, but her
      eyes were full of malicious light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind, Salem,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;You just leave Mr. Bradley to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not worth spooning over, said Mapleleafe indignantly; &lsquo;and let me
      tell you, Eustasia, you&rsquo;re not strong enough to go on like this. Think of
      your state of health! Doctor Quin says you&rsquo;ll break up if you don&rsquo;t take
      care!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and looked at her in consternation. She was lying back in the
      sofa with her thin arms joined behind her head, and &lsquo;crooning&rsquo; to herself,
      as was her frequent habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the words and tune were from a familiar play, which she had seen
      represented at San Francisco.

    <p>
      &lsquo;I do believe you&rsquo;re downright <i>mad!</i>&rsquo; exclaimed the little
      Professor. &lsquo;Tell me the truth, Eustasia&mdash;do you love this man
      Bradley?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustasia ceased singing, but remained in the same attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I loved him who is dead,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;and I love Mr. Bradley because he
      is so like the other. If you give me time I will win him over; I will make
      him love me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What nonsense you&rsquo;re talking!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense? It&rsquo;s the truth!&rsquo; cried Eustasia, springing up and facing her
      brother. &lsquo;Why should I not love him? Why should he not love me? Am I to
      spend all my life like a slave, with no one to care for me, no one to give
      me a kind word? I won&rsquo;t do it. I want to be free. I&rsquo;m tired of sitting at
      home all day alone, and playing the sibyl to the fools you bring here at
      night. Lord knows I haven&rsquo;t long to live; before I die I want to draw in
      one good long breath of love and joy! Perhaps it will kill me as you say&mdash;so
      much the better&mdash;I should like to die like that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eustasia, will you listen to reason?&rsquo; exclaimed the distracted Professor.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re following a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, that&rsquo;s what you are! This man don&rsquo;t
      care about any woman in the world but one, and you&rsquo;re wasting your
      precious time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know my power, and you know it too, Salem. I&rsquo;m going to bring him to my
      feet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How, Eustasia?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait, and you will see!&rsquo; answered the girl, with her low, nervous laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think better of it!&rsquo; persisted her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You promised me, after Ulysses S. Stedman died, to devote all your life,
      strength, and thought to the beautiful cause of scientific spiritualism.
      Nature has made you a living miracle, Eustasia! I do admire to see one so
      gifted throwing herself away, just like a schoolgirl, on the first
      good-looking man she meets!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hate spiritualism,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;What has it done for me? Broken my
      heart, Salem, and wasted my life. I&rsquo;ve dwelt too long with ghosts; I want
      to feel my life as other women do. And I tell you I <i>will!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The poor Professor shook his head dubiously, but saw that there was no
      more to be said&mdash;at any rate just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock that evening Bradley returned to the house in Bayswater,
      and found the brother and sister waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustasia wore a loose-fitting robe of black velvet, cut low round the
      bust, and without sleeves. Her neck and arms were beautifully though
      delicately moulded, white and glistening as satin, and the small
      serpent-like head, with its wonderfully brilliant eyes, was surmounted by
      a circlet of pearls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley looked at her in surprise. Never before had she seemed so weirdly
      pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor, on the other hand, despite his gnome-like brow, appeared
      unusually ignoble and commonplace. He was ill at ease, too, and cast
      distrustful glances from time to time at his sister, whose manner was as
      brilliant as her appearance, and who seemed to have cast aside the
      depression which she had shown during the early part of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some little desultory conversation, Bradley expressed his impatience
      for the <i>séance</i> to begin. The landlady of the house, herself (as the
      reader is aware) an adept, was therefore summoned to give the party, and
      due preparations made by drawing the window-blinds and extinguishing the
      gas. Before the lights were quite put out, however, the Professor
      addressed his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eustasia, you&rsquo;re not well! Say the word, and I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Bradley will
      excuse you for to-night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The appeal was in vain, Eustasia persisting. The <i>séance</i> began. The
      Professor and Mrs. Piozzi Smith were <i>vis-à-vis</i>, while Eustasia, her
      back towards the folding-doors communicating to the inner chamber, sat
      opposite to Bradley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman was far less master of himself than on the former occasions.
      No sooner did he find himself in total darkness than his heart began to
      beat with great muffled throbs, and nervous thrills ran through his frame.
      Before there was the slightest intimation of any supernatural presence, he
      seemed to see before him the dead face of his wife, white and awful as he
      had beheld it in that darkened chamber at Boulogne. Then the usual
      manifestations began; bells were rung, faint lights flashed hither and
      thither, the table round which they were seated rose in the air,
      mysterious hands were passed over Bradley&rsquo;s face. He tried to retain his
      self-possession, but found it impossible; a sickening sense of horror and
      fearful anticipation overmastered him, so that the clammy sweat stood upon
      his brow, and his body trembled like a reed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the voice of the little Professor was heard saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is present? Will any of our dear friends make themselves known?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a momentary pause. Then an answer came in the voice of Eustasia,
      but deeper and less clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Laura, a spirit of the winged planet Jupiter. I speak through the bodily
      mouth of our dear sister, who is far away, walking with my brethren by the
      lake of golden fire.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you alone?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;N! others are present&mdash;I see them passing to and fro. One is bright
      and beautiful. Her face is glorious, but she wears a raiment like a
      shroud.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does that betoken?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It betokens that she has only just died.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A shiver ran through Bradley&rsquo;s frame. Could the dead indeed be present?
      and if so, what dead? His thoughts flew back once more to that miserable
      death-chamber by the sea. The next moment something like a cold hand
      touched him, and alow voice murmured in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ambrose! are you listening? It is I!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who speaks?&rsquo; he murmured under breath. &lsquo;Alma! Do you know me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible? Doubtless lbs phantasy deceived him, but he seemed once
      more to hear the very tones of her he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not move!&rsquo; continued the voice. &lsquo;Perhaps this is a last meeting for a
      long time, for I am called away. It is your Alma&rsquo;s spirit that speaks to
      you; her body lies dead at Rome.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A wild cry burst from Bradley&rsquo;s lips, and he sank back in his chair,
      paralysed and overpowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a cheat!&rsquo; he gasped. &lsquo;It is no spirit that is speaking to me, but a
      living woman.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he clutched in the direction of the voice, but touched only the empty
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you break the conditions, I must depart!&rsquo; cried the voice faintly, as
      if from a distant part of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I break up the <i>séance?</i>&rsquo; asked the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; cried Bradley, again joining his hands with those of his neighbours
      to complete the circle. &lsquo;Go on! go on!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are our dear friends still present?&rsquo; demanded the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am here,&rsquo; returned the voice of Eustasia. &lsquo;I see the spirit of a woman,
      weeping and wringing her hands; it is she that wears the shroud. She
      speaks to me. She tells us that her earthly name was a word which
      signifies holy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In God&rsquo;s name,&rsquo; cried Bradley, &lsquo;what does it mean? She of whom you speak
      is not dead?&mdash;no, no!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he felt the touch of a clammy hand, and again he heard the
      mysterious voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Death is nothing; it is only a mystery&mdash;a change. The body is
      nothing; the spirit is all-present and all-powerful. Keep quiet; and I
      will try to materialise myself even more.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat still in shivering expectation; then he felt a touch like breath
      upon his forehead, and two lips, warm with life, were pressed close to
      his, while at the same moment he felt what seemed a human bosom heaving
      against his own. If this phenomenon was supernatural, it was certainly
      very real; for the effect was of warm and living flesh. Certain now that
      he was being imposed upon, Bradley determined to make certain by seizing
      the substance of the apparition. He had scarcely, however, withdrawn his
      arms from the circle, when the phenomenon ceased; there was a loud cry
      from the others present; and on the gas being lit, Eustasia and the rest
      were seen sitting quietly in their chairs, the former just recovering from
      a state of trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I warned you, Eustasia,&rsquo; cried the Professor indignantly. &lsquo;I knew Mr.
      Bradley was not a fair inquirer, and would be certain to break the
      conditions.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is an outrage,&rsquo; echoed the lady of the house. &lsquo;The heavenly
      intelligences will never forgive us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without heeding these remonstrances, Bradley, deathly pale, was gazing
      intently at Eustasia. She met his gaze quietly enough, but her heightened
      colour and sparkling eyes betokened that she was labouring under great
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is infamous!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;I am certain <i>now</i> that this is a vile
      conspiracy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care, sir, take care!&rsquo; exclaimed the
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s law in the land, and&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, Salem!&rsquo; said Eustasia gently. &lsquo;Mr. Bradley does not mean what he
      says. He is too honourable to make charges which he cannot substantiate,
      even against a helpless girl. He is agitated by what he has seen tonight,
      but he will do us justice when he has thought it over.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without replying, Bradley took up his hat and moved to the door; but,
      turning suddenly, he again addressed the medium:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot guess by what means you have obtained your knowledge of my
      private life, but you are trading upon it to destroy the happiness of a
      fellow-creature. God forgive you! Your own self-reproach and self-contempt
      will avenge me; I cannot wish you any sorer punishment than the infamy and
      degradation of the life you lead.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words he would have departed, but, swift as lightning, Eustasia
      flitted across the room and blocked his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go yet!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;Of what do you accuse me? Why do you blame me
      for what the spirits have done?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The spirits!&rsquo; he repeated bitterly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not a child, to be so easily
      befooled. In one sense, indeed, you have conjured up devils, who some day
      or another will compass your own destruction.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s true enough&mdash;they <i>may</i> be devils,&rsquo; said Eustasia.
      &lsquo;Salem knows&mdash;we all know&mdash;that we can&rsquo;t prevent the powers of
      evil from controlling the powers of good, and coming in their places.
      Guess some of them have been at work to-night. Mr. Bradley, perhaps it&rsquo;s
      our last meeting on earth. Won&rsquo;t you shake hands?&rsquo; As she spoke her wild
      eyes were full of tears, which streamed down her face. Acting under a
      sudden impulse, Bradley took her outstretched hand, held it firmly, and
      looked her in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confess the cheat, and I will freely forgive you. It was <i>you</i>
      personated one who is dear to me, and whom you pretended to be a spirit
      risen from the grave.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t answer him, Eustasia!&rsquo; exclaimed the Professor. &lsquo;He ought to know
      that&rsquo;s impossible, for you never left your seat.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; said Mrs. Piozzi Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bradley, not heeding the interruption, still watched the girl and
      grasped her passive hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Answer me! Tell me the truth!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I tell you?&rsquo; answered Eustasia. &lsquo;I was tranced, and my spirit was
      far away. I don&rsquo;t even know what happened.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a contemptuous gesture, Bradley released her, and walked from the
      room. All his soul revolted at the recent experience; yet mingled with his
      angry scepticism was a certain vague sense of dread. If, after all, he had
      not been deceived, and something had happened to Alma; if, as the <i>séance</i>
      seemed to suggest, she was no longer living! The very thought almost
      turned his brain. Dazed and terrified, he made his way down the dark
      passage and left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had he gone than Eustasia uttered a low cry, threw her arms into
      the air, and sank swooning upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother raised her in a moment, and placed her upon the sofa. It was
      some minutes before she recovered. When she did so, and gazed wildly
      around, there was a tiny fleck of red upon her lips, like blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up in her brother&rsquo;s face, and began laughing hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eustasia! For God&rsquo;s sake, control yourself! You&rsquo;ll make yourself
      downright ill!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the hysterical fit passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave us together, please!&rsquo; she said to the grim woman of the house. &lsquo;I&mdash;I
      wish to speak to my brother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly the woman had retired, she took her brother by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me, Salem!&rsquo; she said softly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not long for this
      world now, and I want you to grant me one request.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it, Eustasia?&rsquo; asked the Professor, touched by her strangely
      tender manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t take me away from England just yet. Wait a little while longer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eustasia, let me repeat, you&rsquo;re following a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, you are
      indeed! Take my advice, and never see that man again!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must&mdash;I will!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;O Salem, I&rsquo;ve used him cruelly, but I
      love him! I shall die now if you take me away!&rsquo;
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s the days passed,
      Bradley found his state of suspense and anxiety intolerable. Day after day
      he had hoped to hear from Alma, until at length disappointment culminated
      in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then determined he should know with certainty what had become of her,
      and resolved to go to Milan.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he had seen at the <i>séance</i> had impressed him more than he would
      admit to himself. He could not believe that any evil had happened&mdash;he
      would not believe it without the most positive evidence of the fact. So he
      said to himself one hour, and the next his heart grew sick with an
      uncontrollable dread; and he refused to hope that the revelation of the <i>séance</i>
      was a delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left his home and proceeded to the station in the former mood, but the
      train had hardly moved from the platform when his despair seized him, and
      if he could he would have relinquished the journey. Alternating thus
      between hope and despair, he travelled without a break, and in due course
      he reached Milan.
    </p>
    <p>
      His inquiries about Alma were promptly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful and wealthy English lady was well known. She had, until
      quite recently, been the occupant of a splendid suite of apartments in the
      best quarter of the city; but she had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley heard all this, and almost savagely he repeated after his
      informant, an old Italian waiter who spoke English well, the word &lsquo;Gone!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone where?&rsquo; he demanded. &lsquo;You must know where she has gone to?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Signor; she has gone to Rome!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Rome! And her address there is&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I do not know, Signor.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have me taken to the house she occupied when here,&rsquo; Bradley ordered; and
      he was driven to the house Alma had dwelt in.
    </p>
    <p>
      There also he failed to learn Alina&rsquo;s address. All that was known was that
      she had gone to Rome; that her departure had been sudden, and that she had
      said she would not return to Milan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dismissing the carriage that had brought him, he walked back to his hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was night; the cool breeze from the Alps was delightfully refreshing
      after the sultry heat of the day; the moon was full and the fair old city
      was looking its fairest, but these things Bradley heeded not. Outward
      beauty he could not see, for all his mind and soul was dark&mdash;the
      ancient palaces, the glorious Cathedral, the splendid Carrara marble
      statue of Leonardo, and the bronze one of Cavour, were passed unnoticed
      and uncared for. One thing only was in his mind&mdash;to get to Rome to
      find Alma. One thing was certain: she had left Milan in good health, and
      must surely be safe still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he said to himself, &lsquo;when did she leave Milan? Fool that I am, not
      to have learned,&rsquo; and, almost running, he returned to the house and
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was disappointed with the information he received. Alma had left Milan
      some time before the <i>séance</i> in London had been held.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering a restaurant, he found that he could get a train to Tome at
      midnight. He returned to his hotel, ate a morsel of food, drank some wine,
      and then went to the railway station.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early morning when he entered the Eternal City, and the lack of
      stir upon the streets troubled and depressed him. It accentuated the
      difference between his present visit and the last he had made, and he
      cried in his heart most bitterly that the burden of his sorrow was too
      great.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to tell the driver of the fiacre to take him to his old
      quarters on the Piazza di Spagna, when he changed his mind. If he went
      there he would be in the midst of his countrymen, and in his then mood the
      last being he wished to see was an Englishman. So he asked the driver to
      take him to any quiet and good boarding-house he knew, and was taken to
      one in the Piazza Sta. Maria in Monti.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the day he went out to learn what he could of Alma.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met several acquaintances, but they had neither seen nor heard of her;
      indeed, they were not in her circle, and though they had seen or heard of
      her, they would hardly have remembered. Bradley well knew the families
      Alma would be likely to visit, but he shrank from inquiring at their
      houses; he went to the doors of several and turned away without asking to
      be admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by he went into the Caffé Nuovo, and eagerly scanned the papers,
      but found no mention of Alma in them. A small knot of young Englishmen and
      Americans sat near to him, and he thought at last that he caught the name
      of Miss Craik mentioned in their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened with painful attention, and found that they were speaking of
      some one the Jesuits had &lsquo;hooked,&rsquo; as they put it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And, by Jove, it was a haul!&rsquo; one young fellow said. &lsquo;Any amount of cash,
      I am told.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is so,&rsquo; replied one of his comrades; and the girl is wonderfully
      beautiful, they say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley started at this, and listened more intently than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; the first speaker said, &lsquo;she is beautiful. I had her pointed out to
      me in Milan, and I thought her the best-looking woman I had ever seen.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excuse me,&rsquo; said Bradley, stepping up to the speakers. &lsquo;I&mdash;I would
      like to know the name of the lady you refer to.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, certainly; her name is Miss Alma Craik.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alma living!&rsquo; Bradley shrieked, and staggered, like one in drink, out of
      the caffé.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dazed and half maddened, he found his way to the lodging. He locked the
      door of his room and paced the floor, now clenching his hands together,
      then holding his forehead in them as if to still its bounding pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Taken by the Jesuits!&rsquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then she is dead indeed&mdash;ay, worse than dead!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused at length at the window and looked out. The next instant he
      sprang back with a look of utter horror on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What if she is over <i>there!</i>&rsquo; he gasped, and sank into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      By over there he meant the convent of the Farnesiani nus. From the window
      he could see down the <i>cul-de-sac</i> that led to the convent. He knew
      the place well; he knew it to be well deserving of its name, the Living
      Tomb, and that of its inmates it was said &lsquo;they daily die and dig their
      own graves.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If Alma was indeed in there, then she was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley shook off as far as he could his feeling of helplessness and
      hopelessness, and with frenzied haste he rose from the chair, left the
      house, and went over towards the convent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that the only way to communicate with the inmates was to mount to
      a platform above the walls of the houses, and to rap on a barrel
      projecting from the platform. He had once been there and had been
      admitted. He forgot that then he had proper credentials, and that now he
      had none.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was soon on the platform, and not only rapped, but thundered on the
      barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A muffled voice from the interior demanded his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reply was whether an Englishwoman named Craik was within the convent.
      To that question he had no answer, and the voice within did not speak
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed long and repeated his question again and again in the hope of
      obtaining an answer, and only left when he had attracted attention, and
      was invited by the police to desist.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to be done? he asked himself as he stood in the street. Do
      something he must, but what?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have it!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I will go to the Jesuit head-quarters and demand to
      be informed;&rsquo; and putting his resolve into action he walked thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was courteously received, and asked his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My business is a painful one,&rsquo; Bradley began. &lsquo;I wish to know if an
      English lady named Craik has joined your church?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She did return to the true faith,&rsquo; replied the priest, raising his eyes
      to heaven, &lsquo;and for her return the Holy Virgin and the Saints be praised!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And <i>now</i>&mdash;where is she <i>now?</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With painful expectancy he waited for the priest to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now! now, Signor, she is <i>dead!</i>&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley heard, and fell prone upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      On recovering from his swoon, Bradley found himself surrounded by several
      priests, one of whom was sprinkling his face with water, while another was
      beating the palms of his hands. Pale and trembling, he struggled to his
      feet, and gazed wildly around him, until his eyes fell upon the face of
      the aged official whom he had just accosted. He endeavoured to question
      him again, but the little Italian at his command seemed to have forsaken
      him, and he stammered and gasped in a kind of stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment he heard a voice accost him in excellent English; a softly
      musical voice, full of beautiful vibrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry, sir, at your indisposition. If you will permit me, I will
      conduct you back to your hotel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker, like his companions, had the clean-shaven face of a priest,
      but his expression was bright and good-humoured. His eyebrows were black
      and prominent, but his hair was white as snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley clutched him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&mdash;what does it mean? I must have been dreaming. I came here to
      inquire after a dear friend&mdash;a lady; and that man told me&mdash;told
      me&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray calm yourself,&rsquo; said the stranger gently. &lsquo;First let me take you
      home, and then I myself will give you whatever information you desire.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; cried Bradley, &lsquo;I will have the truth <i>now!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he faced the group of priests his eyes flashed and his hands were
      clenched convulsively. To his distracted gaze they seemed like evil
      spirits congregated for his torture and torment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it you desire to know?&rsquo; demanded he who had spoken in English. As
      he spoke he glanced quietly at his companions, with a significant movement
      of the eyebrows; and, as if understanding the sign, they withdrew from the
      apartment, leaving himself and Bradley quite alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray sit down,&rsquo; he continued gently, before Bradley could answer his
      former question.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the other paid no attention to the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not trifle with me,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;but tell me at once what I demand to
      know. I have been to the convent, seeking one who is said to have recently
      joined your church&mdash;which God forbid! When I mentioned her name I
      received no answer; but it is common gossip that a lady bearing her name
      was recently taken there. You can tell me if this is true.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest looked at him steadfastly, and, as it seemed, very sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you tell me the lady&rsquo;s name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is known as Miss Alma Craik, but she has a right to another name,
      which she shall bear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said the other, with a deep sigh and a look full of infinite
      compassion, &lsquo;I knew the poor lady well. Perhaps, if you have been in
      correspondence with her, she mentioned my name&mdash;the Abbé Brest?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; exclaimed Bradley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it you wish to know concerning her? I will help you as well as I
      can.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;First, I wish to be assured that that man lied (though of course I <i>know</i>
      he lied) when he said that evil had happened to her, that&mdash;that she
      had died. Next, I demand to know where she is, that I may speak to her. Do
      not attempt to keep her from me! I <i>will</i> see her!&rsquo; The face of the
      Abbé seemed to harden, while his eyes retained their sad, steadfast gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; he said after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, &lsquo;and do not think that I
      put the question in rudeness or with any want of brotherly sympathy&mdash;but
      by what right do you, a stranger, solicit this information? If I give it
      you, I must be able to justify myself before my superiors. The lady, or,
      as I should rather say, our poor Sister, is, as I understand, in no way
      related to you by blood?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is my <i>wife!</i>&rsquo; answered Bradley.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now the other&rsquo;s turn to express, or at least assume, astonishment.
      Uttering an incredulous exclamation, he raised his eyes to heaven, and
      slightly elevated his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think I lie?&rsquo; cried Bradley sternly. &lsquo;Do you think I lie, like
      those of your church, whose trade it is to do so? I tell you I have come
      here to claim her who is my wife, by the laws of man and God!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the Abbé repeated his pantomime expressive of pitiful incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely you deceive yourself,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Miss Craik was never married. She
      lived unmated, and in blessed virginity was baptised into our church.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is she? Let me speak to her!&rsquo; cried Bradley, with a sudden access
      of his old passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbé pointed upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is with the saints of heaven!&rsquo; he said, and crossed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the unfortunate clergyman&rsquo;s head went round, and again he seemed
      about to fall; but recovering himself with a shuddering effort, he
      clutched the priest by the arm, exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Torture me no more! You are juggling with my life, as you have done with
      hers. But tell me it is all false, and I will forgive you. Though you are
      a priest, you have at least the heart of a man. Have pity! If what you
      have said is true, I am destroyed body and soul&mdash;yes, body and soul!
      Have mercy upon me! Tell me my darling is not dead!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe&rsquo;s face went white as death, and at the same moment his lustrous
      eyes seemed to fill with tears. Trembling violently, he took Bradley&rsquo;s
      hand, and pressed it tenderly. Then releasing him, he glanced upward and
      turned towards the door of the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay here till I return,&rsquo; he said in a low voice, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half swooning, Bradley sank into a chair, covering his face with his
      hands. A quarter of an hour passed, and he still remained in the same
      position. Tears streamed from his eyes, and from time to time he moaned
      aloud in complete despair. Suddenly he felt a touch upon his shoulder, and
      looking up he again encountered the compassionate eyes of the Abbé Brest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come with me!&rsquo; the Abbé said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley was too lost in his own wild fears and horrible conjectures to
      take any particular note of the manner of the priest. Had he done so, he
      would have perceived that it betrayed no little hesitation and agitation.
      But he rose eagerly, though as it were mechanically, and followed the Abbé
      to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute afterwards they were walking side by side in the open sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the bewildered mind of Ambrose Bradley it all seemed like a dream. The
      sunlight dazzled his brain so that his eyes could scarcely see, and he was
      only conscious of hurrying along through a crowd of living ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he stopped, tottering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; cried the Abbé, supporting him. &lsquo;You are ill again,
      I fear; let me call a carriage.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, suiting the action to the word, he beckoned up a carriage which was
      just then passing. By this time Bradley had recovered from his momentary
      faintness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you taking me?&rsquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get in, and I will tell you!&rsquo; returned the other; and when Bradley had
      seated himself, he leant over to the driver and said something in a low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley repeated his question, while the vehicle moved slowly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to make inquiries,&rsquo; was the reply; &lsquo;and as an assurance of my
      sympathy and good faith, I have obtained permission for you to accompany
      me. But let me now conjure you to summon all your strength to bear the
      inevitable; and let it be your comfort if, as I believe and fear,
      something terrible has happened, to know that there is much in this world
      sadder far than death.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ask you once more,&rsquo; said Bradley in a broken voice, &lsquo;where are you
      taking me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To those who can set your mind at rest, once and for ever.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are they?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Farnesiani sisters,&rsquo; returned the Abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley sank back on his seat stupefied, with a sickening sense of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mental strain and agony were growing almost too much for him to bear.
      Into that brief day he had concentrated the torture of a lifetime; and
      never before had he known with what utterness of despairing passion he
      loved the woman whom he indeed held to be, in the sight of God, his wife.
      With frenzied self-reproach he blamed himself for all that had taken
      place. Had he never consented to an ignoble deception, never gone through
      the mockery of a marriage ceremony with Alma, they might still have been
      at peace together; legally separated for the time being, but spiritually
      joined for ever; pure and sacred for each other, and for all the world.
      But <i>now</i>&mdash;now it seemed that he had lost her, body and soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage presently halted, and Bradley saw at a glance that they were
      at the corner of the <i>cul-de-sac</i> leading to the convent. They
      alighted, and the Abbé paid the driver. A couple of minutes later they
      were standing on the platform above the walls of the houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      All around them the bright sunshine burnt golden over the quivering roofs
      of Rome, and the sleepy hum of the Eternal City rolled up to them like the
      murmur of a summer sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they stood like two black spots on the aerial brightness; and again
      Bradley fell into one of those waking trances which he had of late so
      frequently experienced, and which he had frequently compared, in his
      calmer moments, to the weird seizures of the young Prince, &lsquo;blue-eyed and
      fair of face,&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Princess.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved, looked, spoke as usual, showing no outward indication of his
      condition; but a mist was upon his mind, and nothing was real; he seemed
      rather a disembodied spirit than a man; the Abbe&rsquo;s voice strange and far
      off, though clear and distinct as a bell; and when the Abbé rapped on the
      barrel, as he himself had done so recently, the voice that answered the
      summons sounded like a voice from the very grave itself.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t seemed a dream
      still, but a horrible sunless dream, all that followed; and in after years
      Ambrose Bradley never remembered it without a thrill of horror, finding it
      ever impossible to disentangle the reality from illusion, or to separate
      the darkness of the visible experience from that of his own mental
      condition. But this, as far as he could piece the ideas together, was what
      he remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accompanied by the mysterious Abbé, he seemed to descend into the bowels
      of the earth, and to follow the figure of a veiled and sibylline figure
      who held a lamp. Passing through dark subterranean passages, he came to a
      low corridor, the walls and ceiling of which were of solid stone, and at
      the further end of which was a door containing an iron grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest approached the door, and said something in a low voice to some
      one beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause; then the door revolved on its hinges, and they entered,&mdash;to
      find themselves in a black and vault-like chamber, the darkness of which
      was literally &lsquo;made visible&rsquo; by one thin, spectral stream of light,
      trickling through an orifice in the arched ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they found themselves in the presence of a tall figure stoled in
      black, which the Abbé saluted with profound reverence. It was to all
      intents and purposes the figure of a woman, but the voice which responded
      to the priest&rsquo;s salutation in Italian was deep&mdash;almost&mdash;as that
      of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is your errand, brother?&rsquo; demanded the woman after the first formal
      greeting was over. As she spoke she turned her eyes on Bradley, and they
      shone bright and piercing through her veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I come direct from the Holy Office,&rsquo; answered the Abbé, &lsquo;and am deputed
      to inquire of you concerning one who was until recently an inmate of this
      sacred place,&mdash;a poor suffering Sister, who came here to find peace,
      consolation, and blessed rest. This English signor, who accompanies me, is
      deeply interested in her of whom I speak, and the Holy Office permits that
      you should tell him all you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman again gazed fixedly at Bradley as she replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She who enters here as an inmate leaves behind her at the gate her past
      life, her worldly goods, her kith and kin, her very name. Death itself
      could not strip her more bare of all that she has been. She becomes a
      ghost, a shadow, a cipher. How am I to follow the fate of one whose trace
      in the world has disappeared?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are trifling with me!&rsquo; cried Bradley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me at once, is she or is she not an inmate of this living hell?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not blaspheme!&rsquo; cried the Abbé in English, while the veiled woman
      crossed herself with a shudder. &lsquo;It is only in compassion for your great
      anguish of mind that our blessed Sister will help you, and such words as
      you are too prone to use will not serve your cause. Sister,&rsquo; he continued
      in Italian, addressing the woman, &lsquo;the English signor would not willingly
      offend, though he has spoken wildly, out of the depth of his trouble. Now
      listen! It is on the record of the Holy Office that on a certain day some
      few months ago an English lady, under sanction, entered these walls and
      voluntarily said farewell to the world for ever, choosing the blessed path
      of a divine death-in-life to the sins and sorrows of an existence which
      was surely life-in-death. The name she once bore, and the date on which
      she entered the convent, are written down on this paper. Please read them,
      and then perhaps you will be able to guide us in our search.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the Abbé handed to the woman a folded piece of paper. She took
      it quietly, and, stepping slowly to the part of the chamber which was lit
      by the beam of chilly sunshine, opened the paper and appeared to read the
      writing upon it. As she did so, the dim and doubtful radiance fell upon
      her, and showed through the black but semi-transparent veil the dim
      outline of a livid human face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the chamber, she approached a large vaulted archway at its inner
      end, and beckoned to the two men. Without a word they followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still full of the wild sense of unreality, like a man walking or groping
      his way in a land of ghosts, Bradley walked on. Passing along a dismal
      stone corridor, where, at every step he took,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      He dragged
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Foot-echoes after him!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      past passage after passage of vaulted stone, dimly conscious as he went of
      low doors opening into the gloomiest of cells, he hurried in the wake of
      his veiled guide. Was it only his distempered fancy, or did he indeed
      hear, from time to time, the sound of low wailings and dreary ululations
      proceeding from the darkness on every side of him? Once, as they crossed
      an open space dimly lit by dreary shafts of daylight, he saw a figure in
      sable weeds, on hands and knees, with her lips pressed close against the
      stone pavement; but at a word from his guide the figure rose with a feeble
      moan and fluttered away down a corridor into the surrounding darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they seemed to pass from darkness into partial sunshine, and
      Bradley found himself standing in the open air. On every side, and high as
      the eye could reach, rose gloomy walls with overhanging caves and
      buttresses, leaving only one narrow space above where the blue of heaven
      was dimly seen. There was a flutter of wings, and the shadows of a flight
      of birds passed overhead&mdash;doves which made their home in the gloomy
      recesses of the roofs and walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath was a sort of quadrangle, some twenty feet square, covered with
      grass, which for the most part grew knee-deep, interspersed with nettles
      and gloomy weeds, and which was in other places stunted and decayed, as if
      withered by some hideous mildew or blight. Here and there there was a rude
      wooden cross stuck into the earth, and indicating what looked to the eye
      like a neglected grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sister led the way through the long undergrowth, till she reached the
      side of a mound on which the grass had scarcely grown at all, and on which
      was set one of those coarse crosses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ask me what has become of the poor penitent you seek. She died in the
      holy faith, and her mortal body is buried <i>here</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a wild shriek Bradley fell on his knees, and tearing the cross from
      the earth read the inscription rudely carved upon it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sister Alma.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Obiit</i> 18&mdash;.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all. Bradley gazed at the cross in utter agony and desolation;
      then shrieking again aloud, fell forward on his face. The faint light from
      the far-off blue crept down over him, and over the two black figures, who
      gazed in wonder upon him; and thus for a long time he lost the sense of
      life and time, and lay as if dead.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>rofessor
      Mapleleafe speedily saw that to oppose his sister would be inopportune&mdash;might
      perhaps even cause her decline and death. He determined&rsquo; therefore to
      humour her, and to delay for a short time their proposed return to
      America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, Eustasia,&rsquo; he said to her one day, &lsquo;I find I&rsquo;ve got something
      to do in Paris; you shall come with me. Perhaps the change there may bring
      you back to your old self again. Anyhow we&rsquo;ll try it; for if this goes on
      much longer you&rsquo;ll die!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Salem, I shan&rsquo;t die till I&rsquo;ve seen <i>him</i> again!&rsquo; she answered,
      with a faint forced smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      They set about making their preparations at once, and were soon on their
      way to Paris. The movement and change had given colour to Eustasia&rsquo;s
      cheeks, and brought a pleasurable light of excitement into her eyes, so
      that already her brother&rsquo;s spirits were raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll forget him,&rsquo; he said to himself, &lsquo;and we&rsquo;ll be what we were before
      he came!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this Salem was mistaken. Eustasia was not likely to forget Bradley.
      Indeed, it was the thought of seeing him again that seemed to give new
      life to her rapidly wasting frame. She knew that he had left England; she
      thought that, like herself, he might be travelling to get rid of his own
      distracting thoughts; so wherever she went she looked about her to try and
      catch a glimpse of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fixed themselves in Paris, and Salem soon dropped into the old life.
      He fell amongst some kindred spirits, and the <i>séances</i> began again;
      Eustasia taking part in them to please her brother, but no more. She was
      utterly changed; each day as it rolled away seemed to take with it a part
      of her life, until her wasted frame became almost as etherealised as those
      of the spirits with whom she had dealt so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      With constant nursing and brooding upon, her fascination for the
      Englishman increased; it seemed, indeed, to be the one thing which kept
      her thin thread of life from finally breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I could see him again,&rsquo; she murmured to herself, &lsquo;only once again, and
      then (as Salem says) die!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The wish of her heart was destined to be realised: she did at least see
      Bradley once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting at home one day alone, when the door of the room opened,
      and more like a spectre than a man he walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first glimpse of his face Eustasia uttered a wild cry and staggered
      a few steps forward, as if about to throw herself into his arms; but
      suddenly she controlled herself, and sank half swooning into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have come!&rsquo; she said at length, raising her eyes wistfully to his;
      &lsquo;you have come at last!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer, but kept his eyes fixed upon hers with a look which
      made her shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How&mdash;how did you find me?&rsquo; she asked faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came to Paris, and by accident I heard of you,&rsquo; he answered in a hollow
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was silence. Bradley kept his eyes fixed upon the sibyl with a
      look which thrilled her to the soul. There was something about him which
      she could not understand; something which made her fear him. Looking at
      him more closely, she saw that he was curiously changed; his eyes were
      sunken and hollow; and though they were fixed upon her they seemed to be
      looking at something far away; his hair, too, had turned quite grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose from her seat, approached him, and gently laid her hand upon his
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Bradley,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;what is it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed his hand across his brow as if to dispel a dream, and looked at
      her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eustasia,&rsquo; he said, using for the first time her Christian name, &lsquo;speak
      the truth to me to-day; tell me, is all this real?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is what real?&rsquo; she asked, trembling. His presence made her faint, and the
      sound of her name, as he had spoken it, rang continually in her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it not all a lie? Tell me that what you have done once you can do
      again; that you can bring me once more into the presence of the spirit of
      her I love!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of her you love?&rsquo; said the girl, fixing her large eyes wistfully upon his
      face. &lsquo;What&mdash;what do you want me to do?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prove that it is not all a lie and a cheat: if you are a true woman, as I
      trust, I want you to bring back to me the spirit of my darling who is
      dead!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrank for a moment from him, a sickening feeling of despair clouding
      all her senses; then she bowed her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When will you come?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustasia sank into her chair, and, without another word, Bradley departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock that night Bradley returned, and found the sibyl waiting
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quite alone. Since the morning her manner had completely changed;
      her hands were trembling, her cheek was hushed, but there was a look of
      strange determination about her lips and in her eyes. Bradley shook hands
      with her, then looked around as if expecting others.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are to be alone!&rsquo; she said&mdash;&lsquo;quite alone. I thought it better for
      you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time she made no attempt to move; at length, noticing Bradley&rsquo;s
      impatience, she said quietly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will begin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose and placed herself opposite Bradley, and fixed her eyes intently
      upon him. Then, at her request, he turned down the gas; they were in
      almost total darkness touching hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time after Bradley sat in a strange dream, scarcely conscious of
      anything that was taking place, and touching the outstretched hands of
      Eustasia with his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a soft voice close to his ear murmured,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ambrose, my love!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He started from his chair, and gazed wildly about him. He could see
      nothing, but he could feel something stirring close to him. Then he
      staggered back like a drunken man, and fell back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alma!&rsquo; he cried piteously, still conscious of the medium&rsquo;s trembling
      hands, &lsquo;Alma, my darling, come to me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment there was silence, and Bradley could hear the beating of his
      heart. Then he became conscious of a soft hand upon his head; of lips that
      seemed to him like warm human lips pressed against his fore head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gasping and trembling he cried&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alma, speak; is it <i>you</i>?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The same soft voice answered him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it is I!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand passed again softly over his head and around his neck, and a pair
      of lips rich and warm were pressed passionately against his own. Half mad
      with excitement, Bradley threw one arm around the figure he felt to be
      near him, sprang to his feet while it struggled to disengage itself,
      turned up the light, and gazed full into the eyes of&mdash;Eustasia
      Mapleleafe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Never till his dying day did Bradley forget the expression of the face
      which the sibyl now turned towards his own, while, half crouching, half
      struggling, she tried to free herself from the grip of his powerful arms;
      for though the cheeks were pale as death, the eyes wildly dilated, they
      expressed no terror&mdash;rather a mad and reckless desperation. The mask
      had quite fallen; any attempt at further disguise would have been sheer
      waste of force and time, and Eustasia stood revealed once and for all as a
      cunning and dangerous trickster, a serpent of miserable deceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she did not quail. She looked at the man boldly, and presently, seeing
      he continued to regard her steadfastly, as if lost in horrified wonder,
      she gave vent to her characteristic, scarcely audible, crooning laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thrill of horror went through him, as if he were under the spell of
      something diabolic.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he felt impelled to seize her by the throat and strangle her,
      or to savagely dash her to the ground. Conquering the impulse, he held her
      still as in a vice, until at last he found a voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you have lied to me? It has all been a lie from the beginning?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me go,&rsquo; she panted, &lsquo;and I will answer you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Answer me <i>now</i>,&rsquo; he said between his set teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sibyl was not made of the sort of stuff to be conquered by
      intimidation. A fierce look came into her wonderful eyes, and her lips
      were closely compressed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak&mdash;or I may kill you! he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kill me, then!&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;Guess I don t care!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the wild face which mastered him in spite of
      himself. His hands relaxed, his arms sank useless at his side, and he
      uttered a deep despairing groan. Simultaneously she sprang to her feet,
      and stood looking down at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you break the conditions?&rsquo; she asked in a low voice. &lsquo;The spirits
      won&rsquo;t be trifled with in that way, and they&rsquo;ll never forgive you, or me;
      never.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no sign that he heard her, but stood moveless, his head sunk
      between his shoulders, his eyes fixed upon the ground. Struck by the
      sudden change in him, she moved towards him, and was about to touch him on
      the shoulder, when he rose, still white as death, and faced her once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not touch me!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Do not touch me, and do not, if you have a
      vestige of goodness left within you, try to torture me again. But look me
      in the face, and answer me, if you can, truly, remembering it is the last
      time we shall ever meet. When you have told me the truth, I shall leave
      this place, never to return; shall leave <i>you</i>, never to look upon
      your face again. Tell me the truth, woman, and I will try to forgive you;
      it will be very hard, but I will try. I know I have been your dupe from
      the beginning, and that what I have seen and heard has been only a
      treacherous mirage called up by an adventuress and her accomplices. Is it
      not so? Speak! Let me have the truth from your own lips.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell,&rsquo; answered Eustasia coldly. &lsquo;If you mean that my brother and
      I have conspired to deceive you, it is a falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are simply agents in the hands of higher agencies than ours.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Once more, cease that jargon,&rsquo; cried Bradley; &lsquo;the time has long past for
      its use. Will you confess, before we part for ever? You will not? Then
      good-bye, and God forgive you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying he moved towards the door; but with a sharp, bird-like cry she
      called him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay! you must not go!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned again towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then will you be honest with me? It is the last and only thing I shall
      ask of you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I will try,&rsquo; she answered in a broken voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; if you will listen to me patiently.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank into a chair, and covered her face with her hands. He stood
      watching her, and saw that her thin, white, trembling fingers were wet
      with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Promise,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that what I am about to say to you shall never be
      told to any other living soul.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I promise.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not even to my brother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not even to <i>him</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause, during which he waited impatiently for her to
      continue. At last, conquering her agitation, she uncovered her face, and
      motioned to a chair opposite to her; he obeyed her almost mechanically,
      and sat down. She looked long and wistfully at him, and sighed several
      times as if in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Salem says I shan&rsquo;t live long,&rsquo; she murmured thoughtfully. &lsquo;To-night,
      more than ever, I felt like dying.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused and waited as if expecting him to speak, but he was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Guess <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t care if I live or die?&rsquo; she added piteously, more
      like a sick child than a grown woman&mdash;and waited again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I do care,&rsquo; he answered sadly, &lsquo;for in spite of all the anguish
      you have caused me, I am sorry for you. But I am not myself, not the man
      you once knew. All my soul is set upon one quest, and I care for nothing
      more in all the world. I used to believe there was a God; that there was a
      life after death; that if those who loved each other parted here, they
      might meet again elsewhere. In my despair and doubt, I thought that you
      could give me assurance and heavenly hope; and I clutched at the shadows
      you summoned up before me. I know now how unreal they were; I know now
      that you were playing tricks upon my miserable soul.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened to him, and when he ceased began to cry again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never meant any harm to <i>you</i>,&rsquo; she sobbed! &lsquo;I&mdash;I loved you
      too well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You loved me!&rsquo; he echoed in amaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded quickly, glancing at him with her keen wild eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mr. Bradley. When Salem first took me to hear you preach, you seemed
      like the spirit of a man I once loved, and who once loved me. He&rsquo;s dead
      now, he is; died over there in the States, years ago. Well, afterwards,
      when I saw you again, I began to make believe to myself that you were that
      very man, and that he was living again in you. You think me crazy, don&rsquo;t
      you? Ah well, you&rsquo;ll think me crazier when you hear all the rest. I soon
      found out all about you; it wasn&rsquo;t very hard, and our people have ways of
      learning things you&rsquo;d never guess. I didn&rsquo;t look far till I found out your
      secret; that you loved another woman, I mean. That made me care for you
      all the more.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her manner now was quite simple and matter-of-fact. Her face was quite
      tearless, and, with hands folded in her lap, she sat quietly looking into
      his face. He listened in sheer stupefaction. Until that moment no
      suspicion of the truth had ever flashed upon his mind. As Eustasia spoke,
      her features seemed to become elfin-like and old, with a set expression of
      dreary and incurable pain; but she made her avowal without the slightest
      indication of shame or self-reproach, though her manner, from time to
      time, was that of one pleading for sympathy and pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t understand me yet, and I guess you never will. I&rsquo;m not a
      European, and I haven&rsquo;t been brought up like other girls. I don&rsquo;t seem
      ever to have been quite young. I grew friends with the spirits when I
      wasn&rsquo;t old enough to understand, and they seem to have stolen my right
      heart away, and put another in its place.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you speak of such things as if they were real? You know the whole
      thing is a trick and a lie.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she answered quickly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not denying that I&rsquo;ve played
      tricks with <i>them</i>, just as they&rsquo;ve played tricks with <i>me</i>; but
      they&rsquo;re downright real&mdash;they are indeed. First mother used to come to
      me, when I was very little; then others, and in after-days I saw <i>him</i>;
      yes, after he was dead. Then sometimes, when they wouldn&rsquo;t come, Salem
      helped out the manifestations, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, be honest with me!&rsquo; cried Bradley. &lsquo;Confess that all
      these things are simple imposture. That photograph of yourself, for
      example&mdash;do you remember?&mdash;the picture your brother left in my
      room, and which faded away when I breathed upon it?&rsquo; She nodded her head
      again, and laughed strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a man out West that taught Salem how to do that,&rsquo; she replied
      naïvely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it was a trick, as I suspected?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I guess that was a trick. It was something they used in fixing the
      likeness, which made it grow invisible after it had been a certain time in
      contact with the atmospheric air.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley uttered an impatient exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And all the rest was of a piece with that! Well, I could have forgiven
      you everything but having personified one who is now lost to me for ever.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never did. I suppose you <i>wished</i> to see her, and she came to you
      out of the spirit-land.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Now</i> you are lying to me again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;m lying,&rsquo; was the answer; &lsquo;for its gospel-truth I&rsquo;m
      telling you. I&rsquo;m not so bad as you think me, not half so bad.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again shrinking from lier, lie looked at her with aimer and loathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The device was exposed to-day,&rsquo; he said sternly. &lsquo;You spoke to me with
      her voice, and when I turned up the light I found that I was holding in my
      arms no spirit, but yourself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not denying that&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; she answered with another laugh.
      &lsquo;Something came over me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how it happened&mdash;and then,
      all at one, I was kissing you, and I had broken the conditions.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Bradley&rsquo;s brain had cleared, and he was better able to grasp
      the horrible reality of the situation. It was quite clear to him that the
      sibyl was either an utter impostor, or a person whose mental faculties
      were darkened by fitful clouds of insanity. What startled and horrified
      him most of all was the utter want of maidenly shame, the curious and
      weird sang-froid, with which she made her extraordinary confession. Her
      frankness, so far as it went, was something terrible&mdash;or, as the
      Scotch express it, &lsquo;uncanny.&rsquo; Across his recollection, as he looked and
      listened, came the thought of one of these mysterious sibyls, familiar to
      mediæval superstition, who come into the world with all the outward form
      and beauty of women, but without a Soul, but who might gain a spiritual
      existence in some mysterious way by absorbing the souls of men. The idea
      was a ghastly one, in harmony with his distempered fancy, and he could not
      shake it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me,&rsquo; said Eustasia gently, &lsquo;tell me one thing, now I have told you
      so much. Is that poor lady dead indeed&mdash;I mean the lady you used to
      love?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The question went into his heart like a knife, and with livid face he rose
      to Ins feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not speak of her!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;I cannot bear it&mdash;it is blasphemy!
      Miserable woman, do you think that you will ever be forgiven for
      tampering, as you have done, with the terrible truth of death? I came to
      you in the last despairing hope that among all the phantoms you have
      conjured up before me there might be some reality; for I was blind and
      mad, and scarcely knew what I did. If it is any satisfaction to you, know
      that you have turned the world into a tomb for me, and destroyed my last
      faint ray of faith in a living God. In my misery, I clung to the thought
      of your spirit world; and I came to you for some fresh assurance that such
      a world might be. All that is over now. It is a cheat and a fraud like all
      the rest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words he left her, passing quickly from the room. Directly
      afterwards she heard the street door close behind him. Tottering to the
      window, she looked down in the street, and saw him stalk rapidly by, his
      white face set hard as granite, his eyes looking steadily before him,
      fixed on vacancy. As he disappeared, she uttered a low cry of pain, and
      placed her hand upon her heart.

      CHAPTER XXXI.&mdash;AMONG THE MOUNTAINS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so! Give me thy hand, celestial; so!&mdash;<i>Merry
      Wives of Windsor.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was the close of
      a bright sunshiny day in the spring of 18&mdash;. The sun was setting
      crimson on the lonely peak of the Zugspitz in the heart of the Bavarian
      Highlands, and the shadows of the pine woods which fringed the melancholy
      gorges beneath were lengthening towards the valleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through one of these mountain gorges, following a rocky footpath, a man
      was rapidly walking. He was roughly, almost rudely, dressed in a sort of
      tourist suit. On his head he wore a broadbrimmed felt hat of the shape
      frequently worn by clergymen, and in his hand he carried a staff like a
      shepherd&rsquo;s crook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely looking to left or right, but hastening with impatient paces he
      hurried onward, less like a man hastening to some eagerly-sought shelter,
      than like one flying from some hated thing behind his back. His cheeks
      were pale and sunken, his eyes wild and sad. From time to time he
      slackened his speed, and looked wearily around him&mdash;up to the
      desolate sunlit peaks, down the darkening valley with its green pastures,
      belts of woodland, and fields of growing corn.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whichever way he looked, he seemed to find no joy in the prospect,
      indeed hardly to behold the thing he looked on, but to gaze through it and
      beyond it on some sorrowful portent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes where the path became unusually steep and dangerous, he sprang
      from rock to rock with reckless haste, or when its thread was broken, as
      frequently happened by some brawling mountain stream, he entered the
      torrent without hesitation, and passed recklessly across. Indeed, the man
      seemed utterly indifferent to physical conditions, but labouring rather
      under some spiritual possession, completely and literally realising in his
      person the words of the poet:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      His own mind did like a tempest strong
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Come to him thus, and drave the weary wight along.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The wild scene was in complete harmony with his condition. It was still
      and desolate, no sound seeming to break its solemn silence; but pausing
      and listening intently, one would in reality have become conscious of many
      sounds&mdash;the deep under-murmur of the mountain streams, the &lsquo;sough&rsquo; of
      the wind in the pine woods, the faint tinkling of goat-bells from the
      distant valleys, the solitary cry of rock doves from the mountain caves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was Ambrose Bradley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly a year had elapsed since his sad experience in Rome. Since that
      time he had wandered hither and thither like another Ahasuerus; wishing
      for death, yet unable to die; burthened with the terrible weight of his
      own sin and self-reproach, and finding no resting-place in all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before, as the reader well knows, the man&rsquo;s faith in the supernatural
      had faded, he had refined away his creed till it had wasted away of its
      own inanition, and when the hour of trial came and he could have called
      upon it for consolation, he was horrified to find that it was a corpse,
      instead of a living thing. Then, in his horror and despair, he had
      clutched at the straw of spiritualism, only to sink lower and lower in the
      bitter waters of Marah. He found no hope for his soul, no foothold for his
      feet. He had, to use his own expression, lost the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now close upon night-time, and every moment the gorges along which
      he was passing grew darker and darker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the red smokes of sunset one lustrous star was just becoming
      visible on the extremest peak of the mountain chain. But instead of
      walking faster, Bradley began to linger, and presently, coming to a gloomy
      chasm which seemed to make further progress dangerous, impossible, he
      halted and looked down. The trunk of an uprooted pine-tree lay close to
      the chasm&rsquo;s brink. After looking quietly round him, he sat down, pulled
      out a common wooden pipe, and began to smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he pulled out a letter bearing the Munich post-mark, and with a
      face as dark as night began to look it through. It was dated from London,
      and ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reform Club, March 5, 18-.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Bradley,&mdash;Your brief note duly reached me, and I have duly
      carried out your wishes with regard to the affairs of the new church. I
      have also seen Sir George Craik, and found him more amenable to reason
      than I expected. Though he still regards you with the intensest animosity,
      he has sense enough to perceive that you are not directly responsible for
      the unhappy affair at Rome. His thoughts seem now chiefly bent on
      recovering his niece&rsquo;s property from the clutches of the Italian Jesuits,
      and in exposing the method by which they acquired such dominion over the
      unhappy lady&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I will not speak of this further at present, knowing the anguish it
      must bring you. I will turn rather to the mere abstract matter of your
      letter, and frankly open my mind to you on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What you say is very brief, but, from the manner in which it recurs in
      your correspondence, I am sure it represents the absorbing topic of your
      thoughts. Summed up in a few words, it affirms your conclusion that all
      human effort is impossible to a man in your position, where the belief in
      personal immortality is gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I need not go over the old ground, with which you are quite as
      familiar as myself. I will not remind you of the folly and the selfishness
      (from one point of view) of formulating a moral creed out of what, in
      reality, is merely the hereditary instinct of self-preservation. I will
      not repeat to you that it is nobler, after all, to live impersonally in
      the beautiful future of Humanity than to exist personally in a heaven of
      introspective dreams. But I should like, if you will permit me, to point
      out that this Death, this cessation of consciousness, which you dread so
      much, is not in itself an unmixed evil. True, just at present, in the
      sharpness of your bereavement, you see nothing but the shadow, and would
      eagerly follow into its oblivion the shape of her you mourn. But as every
      day passes, this desire to die will grow less keen; and ten years hence,
      perhaps, or twenty years, you will look back upon to-day&rsquo;s anguish with a
      calm, sweet sense of spiritual gain, and with a peaceful sense of the
      sufficiency of life. Then, perhaps, embracing a creed akin to ours, and
      having reached a period when the physical frame begins slowly, and without
      pain, to melt away, you will be quite content to accept&mdash;what shall I
      say?&mdash;Nirwâna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I mean, my dear friend, is this, simply: that Death is only evil
      when it comes painfully or prematurely; coming in the natural order of
      things, in the inevitable decay of Nature, it is by no means evil. And so
      much is this the case that, if you were to discover the consensus of
      opinion among the old, who are on the threshold of the grave, you would
      find the majority quite content that life should end for ever. Tired out
      with eighty or a hundred years of living, they gladly welcome sleep. It is
      otherwise, of course, with the victims of accidental disease or premature
      decay. But in the happy world to which we Positivists look forward, these
      victims would not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Day by day Science, which you despise too much, is enlarging the area of
      human health. Think what has been done, even within the last decade, to
      abolish both physical and social disease! Think what has yet to be done to
      make life freer, purer, safer, happier!
    </p>
    <p>
      I grant you the millennium of the Grand Être is still far off; but it is
      most surely coming, and we can all aid, more or less, that blessed
      consummation&mdash;not by idle wailing, by useless dreams, or by selfish
      striving after an impossible personal reward, but by duty punctually
      performed, by self-sacrifice cheerfully undergone, by daily and nightly
      endeavours to ameliorate the condition of Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Men perish; Man is imperishable. Personal forms change; the great living
      personality abides. And the time must come at last when Man shall be as
      God, certain of his destiny, and knowing good and evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;A Job&rsquo;s comforter!&rdquo; I seem to hear you cry. Well, after all, you must be
      your own physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      No man can save another&rsquo;s soul,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Or pay another&rsquo;s debt!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But I wish that you, in your distracted wandering after certainty, would
      turn your thoughts <i>our</i> way, and try to understand what the great
      Founder of our system has done, and will do, for the human race. I am sure
      that the study would bring you comfort, late or soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am, as ever, my dear Bradley,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your friend and well-wisher,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;John Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;P.S.&mdash;What are you doing in Munich? I hear of curious doings this
      year at Ober-Ammergau, where that ghastly business, the Passion Play, is
      once more in course of preparation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley read this characteristic epistle with a gloomy frown, which
      changed before he had finished to a look of bitter contempt; and, as he
      read, he seemed once more conscious of the babble of literary club-land,
      and the affected jargon of the new creeds of the future. Returning the
      letter to his pocket, he continued to smoke till it was almost too dark to
      see the wreaths of fume from his own pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night had completely fallen before he rose and proceeded on his way.

      <i>Madame Guyon</i>=.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I AM writing these lines in my bedroom in the house of the Widow Gran, in
      the village of Ober-Ammergau. They are the last you will receive from me
      for a long time; perhaps the last I shall ever send you, for more and
      more, as each day advances, I feel that my business with the world is
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What brought me hither I know not. I am sure it was with no direct
      intention of witnessing what so many deem a mere mummery or outrage on
      religion; but after many wanderings hither and thither, I found myself in
      the neighbourhood, and whether instinctively or of set purpose,
      approaching this lonely place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As I have more than once told you, I have of late, ever since my past
      trouble, been subject to a kind of waking nightmare, in which all natural
      appearances have assumed a strange unreality, as of shapes seen in dreams;
      and one characteristic of these seizures has been a curious sense within
      my own mind that, vivid as such appearances seemed, I should <i>remember</i>
      nothing of them on actually <i>awaking</i>. A wise physician would shake
      his head and murmur &ldquo;diseased cerebration;&rdquo; nor would his diagnosis of my
      condition be less gloomy, on learning that my physical powers remain
      unimpaired, and seem absolutely incapable of fatigue. I eat and drink
      little; sleep less; yet I have the strength of an athlete still, or so it
      seems.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I walked hither across the mountains, having no other shelter for several
      nights than the boughs of the pine-woods where I slept. The weather was
      far from warm, yet I felt no cold; the paths were dangerous, yet no evil
      befell me. If I must speak the truth, I would gladly have perished&mdash;by
      cold, by accident, by any swift and sudden means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But when a man thirsts and hungers for death, Death, in its dull
      perversity, generally spares him. More than once, among these dizzy
      precipices and black ravines, I thought of suicide; one step would have
      done it, one quick downward leap; but I was spared that last degradation&mdash;indeed,
      I know not how.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was night time when I left the mountains, and came out upon the public
      road. The moon rose, pale and ghostly, dimly lighting my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Full of my own miserable phantasy, I walked on for hours and descended at
      last to the outlying houses of a silent village, lying at the foot of a
      low chain of melancholy hills. All was still; a thin white mist filled the
      air, floating upward from the valley, and forming thick vaporous clouds
      around the moon. Dimly I discerned the shadows of the houses, but in none
      of the windows was there any light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I stood hesitating, not knowing which way to direct my footsteps or at
      which cottage door to knock and seek shelter, and never, at any moment of
      my recent experience, was the sense of phantasy and unreality so full upon
      me. While I was thus hesitating I suddenly became conscious of the sound
      of voices coming from a small cottage situated on the roadside, and
      hitherto scarcely discernible in the darkness. Without hesitation I
      approached the door and knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Immediately the voices ceased, and the moment afterwards the door opened
      and a figure appeared on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the sense of unreality had been strong before it now became paramount,
      for the figure I beheld wore a white priestly robe quaintly embroidered
      with gold, and a golden headdress or coronet upon his head. Nor was this
      all. The large apartment behind him&mdash;a kind of kitchen, with rude
      benches around the ingle&mdash;was lit by several lamps, and within it
      were clustered a fantastic group of figures in white tunics, plumed
      head-dresses of Eastern device, and mantles of azure, crimson, and blue,
      which swept the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; said the form on the threshold in a deep voice, and
      speaking German in a strong Bavarian patois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I answered that I was an Englishman, and sought a night&rsquo;s shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; said the man, and thus invited I crossed the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As the door closed behind me, I found myself in the large raftered
      chamber, surrounded on every side by curious faces. Scattered here and
      there about the room were rudely-carved figures, for the most part
      representing the Crucifixion, many of them unfinished, and on a table near
      the window was a set of carver&rsquo;s tools. Rudely coloured pictures, all of
      biblical subjects, were placed here and there upon the walls, and over the
      fireplace hung a large Christ in ebony, coarsely carven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Courteously enough the fantastic group parted and made way for me, while
      one of the number, a woman, invited me to a seat beside the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I sat down like one in a dream, and accosted the man who had invited me
      to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What place is this?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I have been walking all night and am
      doubtful where I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You are at Ober-Ammergau!&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could have laughed had my spirit been less oppressed. For now, my brain
      clearing, I began to understand what had befallen me. I remembered the
      Passion Play and all that I had read concerning it. The fantastic figures
      I beheld were those of some of the actors still attired in the tinsel
      robes they wore upon the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I asked if this was so, and was answered in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;We begin the play to-morrow,&rdquo; said the man who had first spoken. &ldquo;I am
      Johann Diener the <i>Chorfuhrer</i>, and these are some of the members of
      our chorus. We are up late, you see, preparing for to-morrow, and trying
      on the new robes that have just been sent to us from Annheim. The pastor
      of the village was here till a few minutes ago, seeing all things justly
      ordered amongst us, and he would gladly have welcomed you, for he loves
      the English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man&rsquo;s speech was gentle, his manner kindly in the extreme, but I
      scarcely heeded him, although I knew now what the figures around me were&mdash;the
      merest supernumeraries and chorus-singers of a tawdry show. They seemed to
      me none the less ghostly and unreal, shadows acting in some grim farce of
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Doubtless the gentleman is fatigued,&rdquo; said a woman, addressing Johann
      Diener, &ldquo;and would wish to go to rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I nodded wearily. Diener, however, seemed in some perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;It is not so easy,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;to find the gentleman a shelter. As
      you all know, the village is overcrowded with strangers. However, if he
      will follow ml I will take him to Joseph Mair, and see what can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thanked him, and without staying to alter his dress, he led the way to
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We were soon out in the open street. Passing several chalets, Diener at
      last reached one standing a little way from the roadside, and knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; cried a clear kind voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He opened the door and I followed him into an interior much resembling
      the one we had just quitted, but smaller, and more full of tokens of the
      woodcutter&rsquo;s trade. The room was dimly lit by an oil lamp swinging from
      the ceiling. Seated close to the fireplace, with his back towards us,
      engaged in some handy work, was a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As we entered the man rose and stood looking towards us. I started in
      wonder, and uttered an involuntary cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was Jesus Christ, Jesus the son of Joseph, in his habit as he lived!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had no time, and indeed I lacked the power, to separate the true from
      the false in this singular manifestation. I saw before me, scarce
      believing what I saw, the Christ of History, clad as the shape is clad in
      the famous fresco of Leonardo, but looking at me with a face mobile,
      gentle, beautiful, benign. At the same moment I perceived, scarcely
      understanding its significance, the very crown of thorns, of which so many
      a martyr since has dreamed. It was lying on the coarse table close to a
      number of wood-carving tools, and close to it was a plate of some red
      pigment, with which it had recently been stained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Johann Diener advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I am glad to find you up, Joseph. This English gentleman seeks shelter
      for the night, and I scarcely knew whither to take him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You will not find a bed in the place,&rdquo; returned the other; and he
      continued addressing me. &ldquo;Since this morning our little village has been
      overrun, and many strangers have to camp out in the open air. Never has
      Ober-Ammergau been so thronged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I scarcely listened to him; I was so lost in contemplation of the awful
      personality he represented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I asked, gazing at him in amaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He smiled, and glanced down at his dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I am Joseph Mair,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Tomorrow I play the Christus, and as you
      came I was repairing some portion of the attire, which I have not worn for
      ten years past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jesus of Nazareth! Joseph Mair! I understood all clearly now, but none
      the less did I tremble with a sickening sense of awe.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That night I remained in the house of Joseph Mail sitting on a bench in
      the ingle, half dying, half dreaming, till daylight came. Mair himself
      soon left me, after having set before me some simple refreshment, of which
      I did not care to partake. Alone in that chamber, I sat like a haunted
      man, almost credulous that I had seen the Christ indeed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>have</i> seen him! I understand now all the piteous humble pageant!
      I have beheld the Master as He lived and died; not the creature of a
      poet&rsquo;s dream not the Divine Ideal I pictured in my blind and shadowy
      creed; but Jesus who perished on Calvary, Jesus the Martyr of the World.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All day long, from dawn to sunset, I sat in my place, watching the
      mysterious show. Words might faintly foreshadow to you what I beheld, but
      all words would fail to tell you what I felt; for never before, till these
      simple children of the mountains pictured it before me, had I realised the
      full sadness and rapture of that celestial Life. How faint, miserable, and
      unprofitable seemed my former creed, seen in the light of the tremendous
      Reality foreshadowed on that stage, with the mountains closing behind it,
      the blue heaven bending tranquilly above it, the birds singing on the
      branches round about, the wind and sunshine shining over it and bringing
      thither all the gentle motion of the world. Now for the first time I
      conceived that the Divine Story was not a poet&rsquo;s dream, but a simple tale
      of sooth, a living experience which even the lowliest could understand and
      before which the highest and wisest must reverently bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I seem to see your look of wonder, and hear your cry of pitying pain. Is
      the man mad? you ask. Is it possible that sorrow has so weakened his brain
      that he can be overcome by such a summer cloud as the <i>Passionspiel</i>
      of a few rude peasants&mdash;a piece of mummery only worthy of a smile!
      Well, so it is, or seems. I tell you this &ldquo;poor show&rdquo; has done for me what
      all intellectual and moral effort has failed to do&mdash;it has brought me
      face to face with the living God.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This at least I know, that there is no <i>via media</i> between the full
      acceptance of Christ&rsquo;s miraculous life and death, and acquiescence in the
      stark materialism of the new creed of scientific experience, whose most
      potent word is the godless Nirwâna of Schopenhauer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Man cannot live by the shadowy gods of men&mdash;by the poetic spectre of
      a Divine Ideal, by the Christ of Fancy and of Poesy, by the Jesus of the
      dilettante, by the Messiah of a fairy tale. Such gods may do for happy
      hours; their ghostliness becomes apparent in times of spiritual despair
      and gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Except a man be born again, he shall not enter the kingdom of Heaven!&rdquo; I
      have heard these divine words from the lips of one who seemed the Lord
      himself; nay, who perchance <i>was</i> that very Lord, putting on again
      the likeness of a poor peasant&rsquo;s humanity, and clothing himself with flesh
      as with a garment. I have seen and heard with a child&rsquo;s eyes, a child&rsquo;s
      ears; and even as a child, I question no longer but believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Mea culpa! mea culpa!</i> In the light of that piteous martyrdom I
      review the great sin of my life; but out of sin and its penalty has come
      transfiguration. I know now that my beloved one was taken from me in
      mercy, that I might follow in penitence and love. Patience, my darling,
      for I shall come;&mdash;God grant that it may be soon!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CONCLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he following
      letter, written in the summer of 18&mdash;, by John Cholmondeley to Sir
      George Craik, contains all that remains to be told concerning the fate of
      Ambrose Bradley, sometime minister of Fensea, and a seceder from the
      Church of England:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Sir,&mdash;You will remember our conversation, when we last met
      in London, concerning that friend of mine with whose fortunes those of
      your lamented niece have been unhappily interwoven. Your language was then
      sufficiently bitter and unforgiving. Perhaps you will think more gently on
      the subject when you hear the news I have now to convey to you. The Rev.
      Ambrose Bradley died a fortnight ago, at Ober-Ammergau, in the Bavarian
      highlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From time to time, during his wanderings in the course of the past year,
      we had been in correspondence; for, indeed, I was about the only friend in
      the world with whom he was on terms of close intimacy. Ever since the
      disappearance of Miss Craik his sufferings had been most acute; and my own
      impression is that his intellect was permanently weakened. But that,
      perhaps, is neither here nor there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some ten days ago, I received a communication from the village priest of
      Ober-Ammergau, informing me that an Englishman had died very suddenly and
      mysteriously in the village, and that the only clue to his friends and
      connexions was a long letter found upon his person, addressed to me, at my
      residence in the Temple. I immediately hastened over to Germany, and
      found, as I had anticipated, that the corpse was that of my poor friend.
      It was lying ready for interment in the cottage of Joseph Mair, a
      wood-carver, and a leading actor in the Passion Play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I found, on inquiry, that Mr. Bradley had been in the village for several
      weeks, lodging at Mair&rsquo;s cottage, and dividing his time between constant
      attendance at the theatre, whenever the Passion Play was represented, and
      long pedestrian excursions among the mountains. He was strangely taciturn,
      indifferent to ordinary comforts, eating little or nothing, and scarcely
      sleeping. So at least the man Mair informed me, adding that he was very
      gentle and harmless, and to all intents and purposes in perfect health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Last Sunday week he attended the theatre as usual. That night he did not
      return to the cottage of his host. Early next morning, Joseph Hair, on
      going down to the theatre with his tools, to do some carpenter&rsquo;s work upon
      the stage, found the dead body of a man there, lying on his face, with his
      arms clasped around the mimic Cross; and turning the dead face up to the
      morning light, he recognised my poor friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is all I have to tell you. His death, like his life, was a sad
      affair. I followed him to his grave in the little burial-place of
      Ober-Ammergau&mdash;where he rests in peace. I am, &amp;c.,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;John Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Judging from some talk I had before leaving with the village priest, a
      worthy old fellow who knew him well, I believe poor Bradley died in full
      belief of the Christian faith; but as I have already hinted to you, his
      intellect, for a long time before his death, was greatly weakened. Take
      him for all in all, he was one of the best men I ever knew, and might have
      been happy but for the unfortunate &ldquo;set&rdquo; of his mind towards retrograde
      superstitions.&rsquo;

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
